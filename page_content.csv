0,461105,"MCKEESPORT (KDKA) – Allegheny County Police say they have issued an arrest warrant for the suspected gunman in an overnight shooting during a New Year’s Eve party in McKeesport.According to emergency dispatchers, the shooting happened near the intersection of Versailles Avenue and Coursin Street before 3:15 a.m. Three men and a woman were wounded in the gunfire.Police are identifying the suspect as 20-year-old Julian Sims.Sims is being charged with one count of criminal attempt homicide, four counts of aggravated assault, and four counts of recklessly endangering other persons as well as firearms violations. Sims is also wanted on a previously existing warrant for firearms violations, police said.He is described as a light-skinned African American male, about five-foot-seven, 145 pounds with freckles and a large tattoo on the left side of his neck that says “Bridgette.”Investigators say Sims should be considered armed and dangerous, and is known to frequent the Wilkinsburg, Braddock and Duquesne areas.For most of New Year’s Eve evening, Gabriel Patterson’s Versailles Avenue house party was the place to be for about 140 people. The party information was posted on Facebook ahead of time.By 3:15 a.m., most of the guests had left, except for three strangers and that’s when the trouble began.“I was sleeping. I woke up; I asked [them] to start clearing out… it’s time to go home. Came downstairs and [they were] sitting on the couch and they [weren’t] ready to go. They got mad that I told them to leave and they started shooting. I was really scared,” Patterson said. “I’d never been in a situation like that in my life.”Groggy from sleep, Patterson woke up quick with terrible images and fear now filling his mind.One of the four people shot was Patterson’s good friend.“That’s my high school buddy. I wrestled with him and played football with him. I know [he] got hit because I [saw] it,” Patterson said. “That was the first time I’d ever seen anything like that. It was extreme.”Police said that young man suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen and is in critical but stable condition. The other three victims suffered minor wounds and are also expected to be okay.For Patterson, fear is now anger and his thoughts are with his friend.“If he’s not alright, it’s not going to be pretty,” he said. “It’s not going to be pretty.”<em>Anyone with information on Sims’ whereabouts is asked to contact the Allegheny County Police Homicide Unit at 412-473-3000.</em><strong>RELATED LINKS</strong><a href=""https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/category/news/local/"" target=""_blank"">More Local News</a>"

Sims, 20, at 4:30 p.m. Thursday in the 400 block of Stokes Avenue in Braddock.Police said Sims was one of four men who crashed the New Year’s gathering about 3 a.m. and then became angry when they were asked to leave.McKeesport resident Gabriel Patterson said about 150 people were packed inside his home near the corner of Versailles and Coursin streets when the festivities came to a frightening and violent end.“It was 3 o’clock in the morning. It was time for bed. They showed up. I told them it was time to leave. They didn’t leave; they got mad that I told them to leave and they start shooting,” Patterson said.Authorities said Sims was one of those uninvited guests who fired the shots. He evaded authorities for 17 days.Police said Sims shot three people in their legs or feet and another person in the abdomen. All were expected to recover.Patterson said he was glad authorities were able to make the arrest.Sims faces charges of criminal attempted homicide, four counts each of aggravated assault and recklessly endangering others, as well as firearms violations.

3,460726,"<strong>HAWTHORNE (CBSLA.com) —</strong>The incident happened shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday in the 13500 block of Cerise Avenue.Investigators said four people were shot when an argument escalated at a party with more than 40 people in attendance.An unidentified mother of two who lives a few houses away from where the shooting occurred said she kept her kids inside when she heard a fight.“I didn’t see it actually happen, but I heard that somebody just walked up and started shooting…we heard a lot of loud arguing, and we heard a lot of gunshots. Then I also heard a car speeding off after the gunshots,” the woman told CBS2’s Kristine Lazar.Police said a person in the speeding car was driving one of the victims to the hospital. That man later died.The three other victims were taken to the hospital and are expected to survive.Another woman who wished to remain anonymous told Lazar that she believes gangs are to blame for what happened.“From my understanding, Hawthorne does not belong to one gang. It’s a melting pot of all different gangs, which is what makes it so dangerous,” she said.Officials haven’t yet made any arrests in connection to the shootings.Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:

9,478925,"<strong>AURORA, Colo. (CBS4/AP)</strong>Three people were found dead inside the townhome near Hampden and Kalispell just after 9 a.m. Saturday. Aurora police Sgt. Cassidee Carlson said two men and a woman appeared to have been killed before officers arrived.A fifth person, identified by a person close to the family as Stephanie Archuleta, escaped unharmed. She called police to report that she saw three people inside the home who “appeared lifeless,” said Carlson, who declined to elaborate about the woman’s escape.A person close to the family confirmed the names of those who died to CBS4. The gunman has been identified as Stephanie Archuleta’s husband, Sonny Archuleta, 33. The other victims have been identified as Stephanie Archuleta’s sister, Stacie Philbrook and her boyfriend, Chris Ratliffe; and Sonny Archuleta’s father-in-law, Anthony Ticali.Sonny Archuleta had been barricaded inside the home in the 16000 block of East Ithaca Place since 3 a.m. Saturday. Neighbors also had called police and said they had heard gunshots coming from the home.“The cop said, ‘Yeah, he’s been on a methamphetamine binge for the past four days,’ ” neighbor Jennifer Williams told CBS4.Several neighboring townhomes were evacuated for safety reasons. Both directions of Hampden were shut down from Kalispell to Laredo for several hours. All lanes of Hampden were reopened at 10 a.m.(credit: CBS)SWAT teams converged outside the home and tried to contact Sonny Archuleta. They were unable to get him to leave the residence. Teams deployed tear gas inside the home about 8:30 a.m. in an effort to get him to come out.SWAT officers fired back at Sonny Archuleta after he shot at their armored vehicles from a second story window. It wasn’t known if officers shot the suspect or if he shot himself.<strong>RELATED: <a href=""https://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/01/06/close-friend-of-victim-in-standoff-wants-more-information-from-police/"">Close Friend Of Victim In Standoff Wants More Information From Police</a></strong>“After we arrived on scene, there were no more shots fired up until he fired at us,” Carlson said. “During this time he was all over the house. He moved furniture. He was throwing things. He was agitated. He was irrational.When officers entered the home they found the three people dead inside.Stephanie Archuleta (credit: Facebook)A motive for the killings was unknown. Police wearing gloves and carrying evidence bags were going over the crime scene.“Obviously we’ll have to determine if it was our rounds or his rounds,” Carlson said.Even though CBS4 has found the names of those involved, police have not confirmed the relationship between the gunman and those found dead or how they were killed.“We have an idea of who they are, but we obviously want to confirm their identities with the coroner,” Carlson said.Next-door neighbor Melissa Wright, a nurse who treated victims of the July movie theater shootings in Aurora, said she was in her second-floor bedroom when she saw the gunman start shooting from his own bedroom window. She said she didn’t know what he was shooting at, and that she quickly dropped to the floor.“I hit the ground pretty fast,” Wright said.Wright said she slid on her belly to the first floor of her home and told police what she saw upstairs. Officers quickly entered her home.(credit: CBS)Wright said she knew the gunman as Sonny Archuleta — a name used by police officers trying to negotiate with the man with the bullhorn. Wright said the townhome may have been inhabited by the gunman, the gunman’s wife, her father and another man.“As the morning progressed I started hearing things more clearly and the cops were saying, ‘Sonny, so and so, I have your wife Stephanie with us,’ ” neighbor Shauna Bustios said.A family member of Chris Ratliffe’s, Edmund Daniel, also spoke with CBS4.“We loved him dearly. We know he was going through some things in life that he was definitely trying to change to right his wrongs in life,” Daniel said.Chris Ratliffe (credit: CBS)Sonny and Stephanie Archuleta previously lived in Englewood. A former landlord, Paul Ramsey, told CBS4 she performed child care at a church. He also said Sonny Archuleta was temperamental.“Sonny was a combustible figure, so I’m not surprised that he could do something off the rails. I’m surprised that he could do this,” Ramsey said.Sonny and Stephanie Archuleta (credit: Facebook)Sonny Archuleta has a criminal past including 2012 misdemeanor arrests for a fugitive warrant out of Aurora for reckless endangerment, in Denver for carrying a concealed weapon, and another in Denver for prohibited use of a weapon.The officers who fired their weapons were placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation, which is standard procedure<em>(TM and © Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Open their arrival, they spoke with a female witness who managed to get away, an adult male later identified as Archuleta, 33, was still inside, and he was armed.Moreover, three other people inside the home -- they've been ID'd as Stacie Philbrook, 29, Christopher Ratliffe, 33, and Anthony Ticali, 56 -- ""appeared lifeless.""The home was quickly surrounded and hostage negotiators managed to make telephone contact with Archuleta. Phone communication continued over the course of several more hours, but the presence of a SWAT team and orders to leave the residence issued over a bullhorn didn't persuade Archuleta to step outside. The cops describe his behavior during this time as irrational.Finally, as 8 a.m. neared, SWAT teamers drove an armored vehicle close enough to the home to break out a window -- an action that apparently prompted Archuleta to fire multiple shots in their direction. But rather than shooting back, the cops tried to inspire his exit via the use of teargas, to no avail.About an hour afterward, Archuleta popped up in a second-story window and started shooting an officers again -- and this time, the cops followed suit, striking and killing him. Upon entering the house, they found Philbrook, Ratliffe and Ticali dead in an upstairs bedroom.What set Archuleta off? One neighbor told <strong>Continue to read more about the Aurora triple murder.</strong>As we As for the weapons used by Archuleta, police at the murder scene recovered .40-caliber handgun, an AR-15 rifle and a pump action shotgun.

Crime scene at an Aurora townhome where a multiple shooting left four people dead Saturday, Jan. 5, 2013.Anthony Ticali, right, in a photograph   shown by friend and neighbor Melissa Wright on Sunday in Aurora. <a href=""http://photos.denverpost.com/2013/01/05/photos-four-dead-inside-aurora-home-including-gunman-shot-by-police/""><b>More photos.</b></a>AURORA — Sonny Archuleta was a talented guy, an artist who filled his garage walls with graffiti murals and fashioned molten glass into pipes and bongs, according to  neighbors. But Archuleta, 33, apparently went over the edge Saturday, killing three people before police shot him to death after he opened fire on them from  the townhouse where he lived with his wife, Stephanie Philbrook Archuleta, 30. Police have not officially identified the gunman or his victims, who were found dead in the home after the six-hour standoff ended Saturday morning. But neighbors and other sources say the shooter was  Archuleta and that the victims were his wife’s father, Anthony Ticali; her sister,  Stacie Philbrook; and  Philbrook’s boyfriend. Philbrook Archuleta  escaped the home by jumping from the second-floor window. She didn’t want to talk to the media, her mother, Shannon Ticali,  said Sunday. “Stephanie needs to grieve the loss of her sister and dad,” Ticali said.        After escaping from the home, Philbrook Archuleta told police her husband was mentally unbalanced, according to a police source. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the gunman was a methamphetamine user.  The Archuletas rented the townhouse   from Stacie Philbrook and had lived there together for about a year, said Melissa Wright, 33, who lives across an alley from the townhouse in the 16000 block of East Ithaca Place. They were an “odd couple,” said Wright, a registered nurse at the Medical Center of Aurora, who worked at a drug-rehabilitation facility in the past. “His eyes were always dilated; he was very loud and running around all the time. I’m a nurse —  my job is to assess people, and he seemed like he was on drugs.“She didn’t seem anything like that; she was very reserved. She seemed like a good girl. Stacie too,” Wright said of Philbrook Archuleta and her sister. Doug Welch, a neighbor,  said he frequently saw Archuleta  outside the house working on his motorcycle. Inside the couple’s garage, Welch said, he could see large murals that Archuleta had painted. Wright said Archuleta built the motorcycle himself and practiced glass blowing. “He was a talented guy,” she said. The couple had been married for at least seven years, said a woman who knows the family but asked that her name not be used because she didn’t want to speak for them. “Sonny and Stephanie definitely loved each other,” Ticali said. They were married in a civil ceremony by a justice of the peace, but on their second anniversary the couple tied the knot again at a religious ceremony at the Word of Life Christian Center, Ticali said. Philbrook Archuleta worked at the Word of Life Academy, a day-care and tutoring center at the church in Lone Tree.   “We need to pray for Stephanie. The loss of her sister, husband and other family member is beyond our understanding,” senior pastor Mark Bagwell  said at Sunday services."

But neighbors and other sources say the shooter was Archuleta, and that the victims were his wife”s father, Anthony Ticali, her sister, Stacie Philbrook and Philbrook”s boyfriend. Philbrook Archuleta escaped the home by jumping from the second floor window. She didn”t want to talk to media, her mother, Shannon Ticali, said Sunday. “Stephanie needs to grieve the loss of her sister and dad,” Ticali said. After escaping from the home, Philbrook Archuleta told police her husband was mentally unbalanced, according to a police source. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the gunman was a methamphetamine user. The Archuletas rented the townhouse from Stacie Philbrook, and had lived there together for about a year, said Melissa Wright, 33, who lives across an alley from the townhouse in the 16000 block of East Ithaca Place. They were an “odd-couple,” said Wright, a registered nurse at the Medical Center of Aurora, who worked at a drug rehabilitation facility in the past. “His eyes were always dilated, he was very loud and running around all the time. I”m a nurse, my job is to assess people and he seemed like he was on drugs.“She didn”t seem anything like that, she was very reserved. She seemed like a good girl; Stacie, too,” Wright said of Philbrook Archuleta and her sister. Doug Welch, a neighbor, said he frequently saw Archuleta outside the house working on his motorcycle. Inside the couple”s garage, Welch said, he could see large murals that Archuleta had painted. Wright said Archuleta built the motorcycle himself, and practiced glass blowing. “He was a talented guy.” The couple had been married for at least seven years, said a woman who knows the family, but asked that her name not be used because she didn”t want to speak for them. “Sonny and Stephanie definitely loved each other,” Ticali said. They were married in a civil ceremony by a justice of the peace, but on their second anniversary the couple tied the knot again at a religious ceremony at the Word of Life Christian Center, Ticali said. Philbrook Archuleta worked at the Word of Life Academy, a day-care and tutoring center at the church in Lone Tree. “We need to pray for Stephanie. The loss of her sister, husband and other family member is beyond our understanding,” Senior Pastor Mark Bagwell said at Sunday services.Sign up for email newsletters"
14,478959,"GREENSBORO, N.C. — Sandra Palmer, 47, shot her 14-year-old son, Maurice Edmonds II, her 18-year-old daughter and the children’s father before killing herself Monday morning after a Edmonds II died in the shooting.  The two other victims, Danielle Imani Jameison, 18, and Maurice Eugene Edmonds Sr., 46, were both seriously injured and are listed in stable condition at Moses Cone Hospital.Jameison is Palmer’s daughter.  Edmonds Sr. is the children’s father, but was not married to Palmer, police said.“The two adults had a 17-year relationship.  There was a dispute in the morning in the living room.  Sandra Palmer was the shooter,” Miller said.Miller says investigators are not sure which child was shot first, but both children were shot before Edmonds Sr.Maurice Edmonds Sr.“She retrieved a firearm and came back in the living room.  She maced Mr. Edmonds Sr. to disable him and began to discharge that firearm, striking her son and daughter multiple times,” Miller said.After Palmer shot her children, police say Edmonds Sr. tried to get the gun away from her before he was shot.Miller said Palmer then locked herself in another room and shot herself with a second handgun.All evidence and statements suggest Palmer acted alone, Miller said.One revolver and a semi-automatic gun were used in the shooting, Miller said.Capt. K.L. Whitesell with the Guilford County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Palmer applied for one gun permit on Dec. 11, 2012.  She retrieved the permit nine days later on Dec. 20.“There were no disqualifiers on the background check — just a couple of minor traffic offenses,” Whitesell wrote in an email.Palmer checked a box that said the reason for purchasing a pistol was, “Protection of self, family home, business property.”  Other options on the permit include “target shooting,” “collecting,” “hunting,” and “other.”  The permit listed a Winston-Salem address as a previous residence.No registration has been found for the second firearm.Credit: WGHPThere are no records of any domestic violence, assault or other related incidents connected to Palmer or Edmonds Sr. in Guilford and Forsyth counties.“It’s very unfortunate and I don’t know what drives people so quickly to jump to firearms to solve a problem.  It makes no sense,” Chief Miller said.  “We are still trying to understand the motive and the intent behind the assault.”<a href=""https://myfox8.com/2013/01/07/police-respond-to-report-of-triple-shooting-in-greensboro/"">On Monday, officers responded</a>Edmonds II and Palmer were both found inside the home.  They were pronounced dead at the scene.Jameison — a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill —  was also found shot inside the home.Edmonds Sr., who ran outside and collapsed after being shot, was found in the driveway.  He was taken to Moses Cone Hospital where he is currently listed in “fair condition.”Maurice Edmonds IIEdmonds II was a student who played basketball at Northwest Guilford Middle School.Northwest students were told about the tragedy Monday afternoon before they were dismissed for the day.  The school’s principal, Rich Thomae, says the students are taking it hard.“He was a very funny person.  Outgoing — he always had a certain energy with him,” said Reggie Davis, a friend of Edmonds II.On Tuesday, some students wore pink in honor of Edmonds II.Debbi Smith says she attends school just down the road from where the shooting occurred.“I’m shocked.  I’m just shocked, because this seems like a really nice part of Greensboro,” Smith said.Bob Ring lives one street over.  He says this is an example of how horrible things can happen even in what’s considered a “nice” area.“If this is domestic violence — that happens anywhere,” Ring said.  “This is a low-crime area.  I don’t worry about stuff out here.  You know, there are crazy people in the world.  Domestic stuff escalates, and this stuff happens everywhere.”Danielle Imani Jameison, 18.Neighbor Zacharias Barfield says he woke up Monday morning to hear Edmonds Sr. screaming.  “He kept saying, ‘My kids!  Help, help, help!  My kids!’  I mean it was surreal.”At first, Barfield said he thought Edmonds was having a heart attack.  But then he noticed the blood.“He was still standing over there when he said he was shot… That’s one of the main things I’ll hear the rest of my life… It’s haunting me — his pleas for help.”Police say the family had been renting the townhome for the past year.  They had never been called to the address before Monday.<strong>Filed in:</strong>

22,479363,"(CBS/AP) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Family and friends will gather at a New Mexico church on Friday to mourn the deaths of a former pastor, his wife and their three youngest children who were allegedly shot by the eldest child, 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego on Jan. 19.Friends said Nehemiah's father, a gang member-turned pastor, raised the family in the Christian faith. Greg Griego, 51, went on missions to Mexico and conducted prayer sessions with former jail inmates and weekly Bible study gatherings. Nehemiah also participated in jam sessions with the Calvary Albuquerque's youth band and pickup basketball games at the church.But now Nehemiah is facing murder and child abuse charges in the deaths of his family - Greg Griego, his wife, 40-year-old Sarah Griego, and three of their children: 
9-year-old Zephania Griego and daughters Jael Griego, 5, and Angelina 
Griego, 2, all of whom were found shot to death inside their rural home south of Albuquerque.An hour-long prayer vigil on Wednesday night drew an estimated 2,000 people.Griego was just a normal teen to Vince Harrison, a former police officer who had known the family for about 10 years through his security work at the church.      ""He did not fit the criteria of a kid who was crazy into guns and wanted to hurt people. That's absolutely false,"" Harrison said.Detectives continue to pour over evidence gathered last weekend at the Griego home. They are also reviewing text messages and calls between Griego and his 12-year-old girlfriend, as well as security video from the church where the teen apparently spent much of the day following the early morning shootings.After the killings, authorities allege that Griego reloaded his parents' two semi-automatic rifles, put them in the family van and planned to gun down Wal-Mart shoppers. Sheriff Dan Houston has said investigators have no information that Griego actually went to a Wal-Mart that day.<a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="""" href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/crimesider/?keyword=nehemiah+griego&amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody"">Complete coverage of Nehemiah Griego on Crimesider</a>

<b><style=""font-size: 8pt""="""">2013 South Valley, New Mexico 
              homicide</style=""font-size:></b>On the night of January 19, 2013, five people 
              were found dead inside a house by police in South Valley, New 
              Mexico. A .22 caliber rifle was used to shoot a woman and three 
              children and an AR-15-style rifle was believed to be the weapon 
              used to shoot an adult male when he came home later. A 15 year old 
              male was arrested in connection with the shooting.<b>Events</b>According to police, Nehemiah Griego first 
              killed his mother with a .22 rifle at around midnight. His brother 
              Zephaniah woke up and Nehemiah told him he had shot their mother, 
              but his brother initially did not believe him until Nehemiah 
              showed him her bloodstained face. He stated to police his brother 
              became upset, and then Nehemiah proceeded to shoot him with the 
              same rifle. He then went into the bedroom his two younger sisters 
              shared and found them crying, and shot them both in the head. He 
              then proceeded downstairs and waited for his father to return 
              home, which he did at around 5:00 am, upon which his son shot him 
              multiple times with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle with a scope.In that statement of facts he gave to police, 
              Nehemiah said that he had been having suicidal and homicidal 
              thoughts, that he had obtained the guns from his parents' closet, 
              that he had mailed a photo of his dead mother to his girlfriend, 
              and that he had intended to drive off and use the guns to kill 
              more individuals and ideally die in a gun battle with police. (The 
              statement will only be admissible as evidence in court if he made 
              it freely and voluntarily without coercion, and that he knew his 
              attorney was not present and waived that right). Under the laws of New Mexico, those of his age 
              charged with first-degree murder are tried as adults, though 
              minors can no longer be given the death penalty or an automatic 
              life-without-parole sentence. He had originally lied to his 
              girlfriend and church officials that his parents were killed in a 
              car accident, and later said that he discovered their bodies and 
              drove off.<b>Victims</b>The five victims were a man, his wife, and 
              three of their children, including two girls and one boy. The man, 
              51-year-old Greg Griego, was a former pastor at the area's Calvary 
              Church who was also a chaplain to the Albuquerque Fire Department, 
              and his wife, 40-year-old Sarah Griego, were the father and mother 
              of the alleged shooter, Nehemiah Griego. The children (9-year-old 
              Zephania, 5-year-old Jael, and 2-year-old Angelina) were 
              Nehemiah's younger siblings.<b>Suspect</b>The suspect is 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego. He 
              was booked into Bernalillo County Juvenile Detention Center and 
              was charged with two counts of murder and three counts of child 
              abuse resulting in death.<b><style=""font-size: 8pt""="""">Wikipedia.org</style=""font-size:></b>

              Jensen - Krqe.comWednesday, July 24, 2013ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) - It has been six months since New Mexicans 
              first heard the news that 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego was arrested 
              for the shooting deaths of his parents and three siblings.Now, with his family still grieving, his future is unclear.""Clearly, there was some sort of break or psychotic break that 
              happened that night,"" said Nehemiah's aunt, and now guardian, 
              Regina Griego.Regina Griego is still grieving the death of her brother, 
              Albuquerque pastor Greg Griego, and his family while trying to get 
              the right mental health care for Nehemiah.Regina visits Nehemiah at the Bernalillo County Juvenile 
              Detention Center every week.""It's a cycle every week for me, to be reminded of the tragedy 
              and the sadness of everything because I miss my brother a lot but 
              I have such compassion for Nehemiah ,"" Regina said.It is that compassion that is driving her to fight for better 
              mental health treatment for Nehemiah.Regina says at the Juvenile Detention Center, he gets one hour 
              of counseling a week and 15 minutes with a psychiatrist.She was not allowed to see his medical records unless he signed 
              them over.""First of all, he's young, cognitively - to me, he's a child. 
              And secondly, he's got some mental impairment,"" Regina said. ""So 
              it has not made sense to me in any shape or form.""Since then, Regina says Nehemiah has a working diagnosis with 
              psychosis and dissociative disorders and has started medication.""Now he has a full range of emotion,"" Regina said. ""He's 
              missing his family. He obviously cries a lot about what happened.""Regina says the Juvenile Detention Center is not the place for 
              someone like Nehemiah, who needs intensive mental health care.""It's a holding point. It's not really a healing point,"" Regina 
              said. ""He's got to get to some mental health care facility to 
              heal.""No one knows the real reason for the killings, except for maybe 
              Nehemiah.Deputies say the homeschooled boy told them he was mad at his 
              mom, but didn't say why.His aunt believes he had undetected mental health issues and 
              just snapped. She said maybe they were brought on by violent video 
              games and easy access to his father's guns.""This could happen to you,"" Regina said. ""I would advise 
              parents to get smart on mental health. ""We're doing it now, after 
              the crisis. Do it before the crisis.""The family has said if the 16-year-old is convicted in the case 
              they hope he's sentenced as a juvenile, which would mean he'd be 
              out of jail by age 21.No trial date has been scheduled.<b>Griegos: Give Him a Second Chance</b>By Jeff Proctor - Abqjournal.comWed, Jan 30, 2013In the early morning hours of Jan. 20, 
              15-year-old Nehemiah Griego sat in an interrogation room at 
              Bernalillo County Sheriff’s headquarters in Downtown Albuquerque 
              and gave a detailed confession of how he had killed his parents 
              and three younger siblings the day before.The only others in the room were BCSO 
              investigators.Right outside the room, Griego’s 21-year-old 
              sister, Vanessa Lightbourne, was asking to be allowed access to 
              her brother. She says her request was denied.Meanwhile, four more adult members of the 
              Griego family say they were outside the building, trying 
              unsuccessfully to get in, to get to Nehemiah, to get an adult 
              seated next to him during questioning.The killings have sparked intense media 
              coverage; public grieving, especially for an Albuquerque 
              megachurch community; and a localized version of the fiery 
              national gun control debate. On Tuesday, the Griegos sat down with 
              the Journal for their first in-depth interview.They say they have many concerns about the 
              case.The circumstances surrounding Nehemiah Griego’s 
              confession rank near the top.Through a spokesman, Sheriff Dan Houston 
              declined to comment for this story. But according to the charging 
              documents, BCSO detectives read the teen a Miranda warning and 
              asked whether he wanted an adult or a lawyer present. He declined 
              and agreed to speak with investigators alone, the documents state.His family says Nehemiah was in no condition to 
              give a statement to authorities, especially not alone.“No lawyer, no adult, no access to any family 
              members, (he) makes a statement, if that’s not damaging enough … 
              for us the hardest thing is that became fact,” said Eric Griego, 
              the boy’s uncle and a former state senator.The family objected to the way Houston and BCSO 
              investigators have publicly revealed details of the confession – 
              presenting them as fact and as evidence that the teen had planned 
              to go on a killing spree after slaying his parents.“As far as we know, that whole narrative that 
              he was going on this grandiose shootout was based on a scared 
              15-year-old in the middle of the night, in the sheriff’s 
              department, no parent, no adult, no lawyer, saying ‘I’m going to 
              do this,’ ” Eric Griego said. “Should he have said it? Of course 
              not. If any of us would have been there, we would have just told 
              him to shut up.”Eric Griego added: “With what we’ve all learned 
              about brain development, something must have gone wrong with his 
              brain.”Above all else, the Griegos want everyone to 
              know they are united in standing behind Nehemiah. They don’t 
              dispute that the boy killed five family members. But they don’t 
              want him tried as an adult.Under New Mexico law, Griego will automatically 
              be sentenced as an adult if convicted of first-degree murder. The 
              charges against him all carry 30-year sentences, although a judge 
              can give him less time.New Mexico law automatically transfers 15-, 16- 
              and 17-year-olds into the adult system as “serious youthful 
              offenders” if they are charged with first-degree murder. The 
              statute was created in 1993 and amended to include 15-year-olds in 
              1996.<b>Redemption for all</b>The Griegos say theirs is a family that 
              believes no one is beyond redemption, no one beyond repair.The belief stems from personal experience: Greg 
              Griego, who authorities say was the last one killed in the 
              family’s South Valley home when Nehemiah ambushed him with an 
              AR-15 assault-style rifle, had fallen into a life of drugs and 
              gangs after a stint in the 82nd Airborne Division and was later 
              “transformed” when he became a Christian while in jail in 
              California in the early 1990s.“We all know what my dad and Sarah (Griego, his 
              wife) would’ve wanted,” said Annette Griego, Greg Griego’s eldest 
              daughter. Greg Grigo had five children before he met his wife, 
              Sarah, with whom he had five more.“We have spent our lives watching them live 
              their lives for others. And we know that, more than anything else, 
              they would’ve wanted Nehemiah to be given a second chance, and 
              that’s what we want as well … If my dad were here, my dad would 
              stand by Nehemiah.”The surviving family members also have taken 
              exception to media portrayals of Greg Griego’s family as an 
              insular, secluded lot.Nehemiah Griego and his siblings were 
              home-schooled, yes, but they spent countless hours at their church 
              and interacted with similarly situated children, according to the 
              Griego family.There was plenty of love in the household, 
              family members said. Greg Griego’s family loved music, dancing, 
              playing games and spreading the Christian gospel together. They 
              were always together.Nehemiah Griego had entered into a quieter, 
              awkward stage, as many teenage boys do, his family said. But no 
              one noticed anything that could have predicted what would happen 
              on the 2800 block of Long Lane SW in the early morning hours of 
              Jan. 19.He was interested in wrestling and music, he 
              was affectionate toward his siblings and he had plans to follow in 
              his father’s and other family members’ footsteps and join the 
              military.They say that what caused Nehemiah Griego to 
              kill five family members – whether it was a yet-undiagnosed mental 
              illness or something else – remains a question mark.“For the sheriff to tell us he had a little 
              disagreement with his mother before he decided to kill her – the 
              absurdity of that makes him out to be this complete sociopath, and 
              that doesn’t make sense,” Eric Griego said.Family members say they have visited Nehemiah 
              in the juvenile lockup, but declined to discuss those meetings and 
              how he’s doing.<b>Always a leader</b>Greg Griego, according to his family, had 
              always been a leader. People followed him – whether it was in the 
              neighborhood near Avenida Cesar Chavez and Eighth Street SW where 
              Greg Griego grew up with a brother, two sisters and a mother who 
              refused welfare despite poverty, or at the Bernalillo County 
              Metropolitan Detention Center, where he spent 13 years as a jail 
              minister.That leadership extended to the way he raised 
              his children and ran his household, according to the Griego 
              family. Greg Griego was old-school.He liked his daughters to have long hair 
              because he thought it looked pretty, said the eldest, Annette 
              Griego, and he liked his sons to be tough.Greg and his wife, Sarah Griego, were loving 
              but strict parents, according to the family. From a young age, the 
              children were involved in the church community at Calvary of 
              Albuquerque, where, until a recent falling out, Greg Griego had 
              spent several years as a pastor.The children weren’t allowed to date until 
              reaching a certain age, family members said. That assertion 
              contradicts BCSO statements that Nehemiah had a 12-year-old 
              girlfriend. Officials say the boy exchanged text messages and a 
              photograph of his dead mother with the girl on the night of the 
              killings.Family members said they weren’t aware of the 
              girl. They had never seen her at family events, and they were 
              positive Greg and Sarah wouldn’t have allowed their son to have a 
              girlfriend.Nehemiah Griego spent much of Jan. 19 with the 
              girl after the killings, according to BCSO. Deputies say she knew 
              what the boy had done, although Nehemiah told different versions 
              of a story about how his family died to others. The girl is not 
              facing any charges at this point.Greg Griego also wanted his family to know how 
              to protect itself. According to family members, would-be burglars 
              had entered the Griegos’ home years ago while Sarah Griego was 
              home with the couple’s children. She managed to scare them away by 
              calling out from another room that she had a shotgun.After that, Greg Griego bought guns, including 
              those his son would later use to kill him and the other family 
              members. He taught his family – including his wife and Nehemiah – 
              to shoot them.The guns weren’t kept under lock and key, 
              according to the surviving family members, because Greg Griego 
              wanted Nehemiah to have access to them if needed to protect the 
              family.Journal staff writer Deborah Ziff contributed 
              to this report<b>Nehemiah Griego's father came home to family 
              massacre in New Mexico</b>By Matt Pearce - Los Angeles TimesJanuary 23, 2013Greg Griego's wife, a son and two daughters 
              were already dead. One of his other sons, Nehemiah, 15, was 
              waiting for him in a bathroom with a high-velocity AR-15 rifle, 
              police say.Greg Griego, who'd turned around a troubled 
              life and involvement with gangs to become a chaplain, apparently 
              had spent his last hours helping the homeless in Albuquerque, 
              according to the Albuquerque Journal.He was returning home from an overnight shift 
              at the Albuquerque Rescue Mission when he was killed early 
              Saturday morning, the newspaper reported.Nehemiah Griego is charged with killing his 
              mother, father and three siblings.The teenager waived his right to an arraignment 
              in adult court Tuesday and was being held without bond. Relatives 
              have asked the public not to politicize the shooting, which has 
              resonated with the nation amid the debate over guns, particularly 
              military-style, semiautomatic rifles. The shootings add to the 
              small portion of gun crimes committed with rifles.Greg Griego's responsibilities at the homeless 
              mission weren't clear; the mission did not respond to a phone 
              message left Wednesday morning. According to the mission's 
              website, it offers emergency overnight shelter to families with 
              children 10 or younger during the winter.Griego had young children of his own at home: 
              Zephania, 9; Jael, 5; and Angelina, 2. They died of gunshot wounds 
              to the head in an early-morning rampage that their brother 
              allegedly contemplated for a week, officials said.According to court documents, Nehemiah Griego 
              took a .22-caliber rifle from his parents' closet, shot his 
              mother, Sarah, as she slept, then shot his 9-year brother who was 
              in bed next to her. The teen said he then ""lost his sense of 
              conscience"" and shot his two younger sisters in a nearby bedroom 
              after they started crying, police said.Police said in a statement that Greg Griego was 
              not a convicted felon and that his guns had been purchased 
              legally.Nehemiah Griego told officials he loaded 
              weapons into the family van and hoped to carry out an assault on a 
              Wal-Mart, then die in a shootout with police, according to court 
              documents. Instead he went to church.There, he told his girlfriend and her 
              grandmother that his family had died in a car accident, and a 
              church security guard called 911, officials said.Police also said the teenager, who is being 
              charged as an adult, had texted a photo of his mother's body to 
              his girlfriend.Nehemiah Griego had ""many friends"" and spent 
              much of his free time playing basketball and playing music, 
              according to a statement from relatives published by KRQE-TV on 
              its website Tuesday night.In the statement, relatives asked the public 
              and the media ""to not use Nehemiah as a pawn for ratings or to 
              score political points."" It was reportedly issued by Eric Griego, 
              Nehemiah's uncle and a former Democratic state senator.""It is clear to those of us who know and love 
              him that something went terribly wrong,"" the statement said. 
              ""Whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed 
              psychological issue, we can’t be sure yet. What we do know is that 
              none of us, even in our wildest nightmare, could have imagined 
              that he could do something like this.""There is so much more to the Nehemiah we know 
              than what the media is portraying. We know him as a bright, 
              curious and incredibly talented young man. He was a brother, 
              nephew, grandson and cousin.""The statement added: ""To be clear, our family 
              has differing views on gun rights and gun control. What we do 
              agree on is that those who wish to score political points should 
              not use a confused, misguided, 15-year old boy to make their 
              case.""<b>Teenager Contemplated Killings for ‘Some 
              Time’</b>By Jeff Proctor and Patrick Lohmann - 
              Albuquerque JournalWed, Jan 23, 2013Nehemiah Griego had long harbored violent 
              fantasies that included mass killings and murder-suicide 
              scenarios.More recently, those fantasies started to 
              crystallize into a specific plan to kill his family, his 
              girlfriend’s family and even strangers at a local Walmart, 
              Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston and one of his lead 
              investigators said Tuesday.According to sheriff’s investigators, the 
              15-year-old followed through with part of the plan early Saturday, 
              when they say he fatally shot his mother and younger brother in 
              bed, his two young sisters in another room and then waited five 
              hours to ambush his father in the family’s South Valley home.Nehemiah’s father, local pastor Greg Griego, 
              had been working an overnight shift at the Albuquerque Rescue 
              Mission before returning home around 6 a.m. Saturday, officials 
              said.Houston said during a news conference Tuesday 
              morning that authorities have “no best judgment on a motive” other 
              than he was “frustrated” with his mother.“This is beyond any human reasoning or 
              understanding at this time,” he said. “It’s horrific. What other 
              word do you use? It’s the first time I’ve been to a crime scene 
              with this much destruction.”Shortly after he shot his mother while she 
              slept – around 1 a.m. Saturday – Nehemiah texted a picture of his 
              mother’s body to his 12-year-old girlfriend, Houston told 
              reporters. And it appears the girlfriend, who spent much of 
              Saturday after the slayings with Nehemiah, knew he had killed his 
              family even as he told different stories to others.BCSO Lt. Sid Covington said it appears that 
              Nehemiah had made comments consistent with his plan for at least a 
              week prior to the shootings, but he would not say who the teen had 
              talked to.“That’s part of the investigation that’s still 
              active,” Covington said.“… We’re still investigating who he might have 
              told and what exactly he told them.”When asked whether he told the girlfriend his 
              plans prior to the killings, Covington said that’s one possibility 
              investigators are looking into.Investigators are searching through the 
              girlfriend’s cellphone as well as Nehemiah’s, the Journal has 
              learned.Houston said the girl could face charges, 
              although he did not say what she could be charged with and did not 
              call her a suspect. A BCSO spokesman said later Tuesday that there 
              are no pending charges, and authorities aren’t contemplating any 
              at this point.Officials said at the news conference that it 
              didn’t appear Nehemiah had any history of mental illness or that 
              he had been taking any kind of medication.<b>Facing 200 years</b>Nehemiah has been in custody at the Bernalillo 
              County Juvenile Detention Center since early Sunday. He was 
              scheduled Tuesday afternoon for an initial appearance in 
              Metropolitan Court on five counts of murder and three counts of 
              child abuse resulting in death.But Nehemiah waived the court appearance, and 
              state District Judge Yvette Gonzales signed a stipulated order 
              between prosecutors and the Public Defender’s Office under which 
              he will be held without bond.District Attorney Kari Brandenburg said Tuesday 
              that the case should be presented to a grand jury within 10 days. 
              Nehemiah will be tried as an adult under the state’s Serious 
              Youthful Offender Act, which applies to any teen aged 15, 16 or 17 
              charged with first-degree murder.If convicted, he could face more than 200 years 
              in prison – 30 years for each murder charge in addition to 30 
              years for each child abused – but because he’s a juvenile, the 
              judge has more sentencing discretion, Brandenburg said.However, she said the gravity of the charges 
              against Nehemiah would give any judge pause before going easy on 
              the teen.“The fact that five people lost their lives – 
              some very young children – that certainly wouldn’t result in a 
              light or minor sentence,” Brandenburg said.The victims are: Greg Griego, 51; Sarah Griego, 
              40; Zephania Griego, 9; Jael Griego, 5; and Angelina Griego, 2.Jeff Buckels, who supervises the Capitol Crimes 
              division of the state Public Defender’s Office, will represent 
              Nehemiah. Buckels did not return calls for comment Tuesday, but 
              Brandenburg said he is an experienced and thorough public 
              defender.“I would suspect that (Nehemiah) will be well 
              represented, and that every issue possible will be addressed fully 
              and completely,” Brandenburg said.<b>More killings considered</b>During Tuesday’s news conference, Houston and 
              Covington answered some lingering questions and provided some 
              previously undisclosed details.Preliminary reports indicate that Nehemiah 
              waited for his mother to fall asleep, and then retrieved several 
              guns from the closet of his parents’ bedroom about 1 a.m. He shot 
              his mother once in the head, then shot his 9-year-old brother 
              multiple times, including in the head, with a .22 caliber rifle, 
              Houston and investigators said.He then shot his two sisters, aged 5 and 2, in 
              another room with the .22 caliber rifle, Houston said. One of the 
              girls was awake, he said, and the other was sleeping. One was shot 
              multiple times; the other once.Covington said Nehemiah shot his father 
              multiple times with an AR-15 assault-style rifle, including at 
              least once in the head.Officials said the teen was familiar with 
              firearms because his father had taught him to shoot.After the killings, Nehemiah reloaded the .22 
              caliber rifle and the AR-15, put them in the family’s van along 
              with several rounds of ammunition and drove away, officials said.They said he had contemplated killing his 
              girlfriend’s family and then “going and ending this at a Walmart 
              with mass destruction.”Instead, Nehemiah spent much of Saturday with 
              his girlfriend and her grandmother, officials said. It’s unclear 
              exactly where they were, and Nehemiah on a few occasions left the 
              two and then reconnected with them.Around 8 p.m., he went to Calvary Chapel on 
              Osuna NE, where his father worked until recently as a pastor, 
              officials said. Nehemiah told a church security guard that his 
              family was dead. The security guard drove the boy to the Griegos’ 
              home on the 2800 block of Long Lane SW and called 911.Nehemiah agreed to speak with investigators 
              without an attorney or an adult present. The interview lasted 
              about 90 minutes, the Journal has learned, and investigators began 
              by asking Nehemiah to talk about himself and his interests.Covington said during the news conference that 
              Nehemiah told detectives he enjoyed playing video games, including 
              Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto. Covington said he didn’t know 
              whether Nehemiah’s parents knew he played those games.Officials said the two guns used in the 
              killings, as well as two pistol-grip 12-gauge shotguns found in 
              the Griegos’ home, had been purchased legally. It is not clear, 
              however, who bought them.Covington said it appears some of the guns 
              owned by Greg Griego – including possibly those used in the 
              killings – had been purchased by Greg Griego’s friends and then 
              either sold to or given to the pastor. BCSO is working with the 
              federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to 
              trace the history of those guns, as well as the two shotguns.Griego had told friends, colleagues and inmates 
              he worked with that he was an ex-con and had done prison time. 
              That raised the question of how he obtained the guns.Houston said that although he has numerous 
              arrests in his past, it does not appear Greg Griego was a 
              convicted felon. A BCSO spokesman said it appears Greg Griego’s 
              arrests were out of state. He could not say what the charges were.<b><style=""font-size: 8pt""="""">Documents show Griego planned

              cause outlines how Nehemiah Griego eventually confessed to killing 
              his family and how he told officers he did not want it to stop 
              there.A Bernalillo County Sheriff's officer recounts 
              questioning Griego after the 15-year-old boy told him he 
              understood his rights and did not want an adult or lawyer present.Griego told conflicting stories before 
              admitting he was ""annoyed with his mother,"" and allegedly 
              confessing to gunning down his parents and three younger siblings. 
              Even how he allegedly sent a picture of his dead mother to his 
              girlfriend.According to the statement Griego also told 
              officers after shooting his family , he reloaded two rifles so ""he 
              could drive to a populated area to murder more people.""Sources say Griego went to the South Valley 
              Walmart after investigators say he killed his family. He sat in 
              the parking lot for up to an hour with an AR-15 assault-type rifle 
              and a .22 rifle with a scope, as he contemplated shooting people 
              at the store.This news shocked shoppers.""I think we were there on Saturday,"" one woman 
              told KRQE News 13. ""That makes me scared. Thing have been 
              happening all over the world, but to have it less than a mile from 
              your home, makes you more scared.""Griego also told investigators, ""he wanted to 
              shoot people at random and eventually be killed while exchanging 
              gunfire with law enforcement.""Sources say he contemplated doing the same 
              thing at Calvary of Albuquerque in the North Valley.Neither happened.Instead, Griego went to the church, where he 
              told a pastor and security guard his family was dead. The security 
              guard then called 911.Dickie Maestas, a neighbor of the Griego 
              family, says he's relieved the carnage stopped on Long Lane.""It's just really sad,"" Maestas said. ""I'm glad 
              it didn't go any further than it did, and it's sad that it ended 
              up the way it did. I'm sure all the neighbors feel the same way.""After confessing, Griego was arrested. He faces 
              two charges of murder , and three charges of child abuse resulting 
              in death.The District Attorney says Griego will be tried 
              as a serious youthful offender, which means he could be sentences 
              as an adult if convicted of first degree murder.Griego could make his first appearance in court 
              on Tuesday.<b><style=""font-size: 8pt""="""">Complaint details horrific 
              murders</style=""font-size:></b>By Magdalena SharpeMonday, January 21, 2013ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) - According to new details 
              released the teen accused of murdering his parents and three young 
              siblings was planning to carry out even more carnage in a public 
              arena.15-year-old Nehemiah Griego made up 
              several stories before finally confessing to authorities that he 
              had killed his father, Greg Griego, mother, Sara, and three young 
              siblings Jael, Angelina and Zephania.Nehemiah 
              had at first told authorities he had come home after being at a 
              friend's house and found his family dead. He said that after 
              finding the bodies he took the family van and drove to Calvary 
              Church where he told his girlfriend that his family had been 
              killed in a car crash.When authorities asked 
              why he had not called 911 the teen said he had panicked.
              The teen also changed his story several times regarding why he had 
              rifles in the cargo area of the van.Although 
              finally after Griego was informed by questioning officers that his 
              story was not making sense, the teen started to tell authorities 
              what had taken place.Griego said he had been 
              annoyed with his mother and was having homicidal and suicidal 
              thoughts prior to the killings. He said on the evening of the 
              murders he had taken a rifle from his parent's closet and used it 
              to first kill his mother. He then killed his younger brother and 
              two younger sisters. The teen then waited for his father to come 
              home and around 5 a.m. Greg Griego did just that. Nehemiah says he 
              waited for his dad to walk past him several times before he shot 
              his father multiple times with a separate rifle.
              The teen told authorities after killing his family he reloaded his 
              weapons so that he could ""drive to populated area to murder more 
              people."" He expressed a desire to shoot people at random and 
              eventually be killed while exchanging gunfire with law 
              enforcement.Luckily he didn't make it that far.
              After giving police the information above he was placed under 
              arrest and is being charged with two counts of murder and three 
              counts of child abuse resulting in death. "

			Trending:		BRENTWOOD — Four teenagers wounded Monday evening in a drive-by shooting may have been targeted for unknowingly wearing shoes denoting a gang affiliation, police said. The teens, who ranged in age from 13 to 16 years old, were standing on a sidewalk in front of a home in the 1100 block of Breton Drive about 6 p.m. when a car with three to four men drove up to them, Brentwood Capt. Tom Hansen said. According to a report on KTVU-TV, a man in the car asked one of the boys why he was wearing Nike Cortez shoes, to which one of the teens, whose identities have not been released, replied, “Don’t worry about it.” One of the suspects reportedly fired back, saying, “Gang members like to wear those.”The car pulled away, made a U-turn, then came back and fired approximately five shots at the boys, Hansen said.Police described the victims’ injuries as “serious,” and all four boys were taken to the hospital for treatment. Two of them have since been released, and one of the teens who remains in the hospital is undergoing surgery to remove a bullet in his knee.Both the victims’ families and the police insist that none of the teens is a gang member, and they were unaware of any significance between gang affiliations and the pair of sneakers.“We have absolutely no reason to believe they are affiliated with any type of gang,” Hansen said.A detailed suspect description wasn’t available, but the men in the vehicle were described as white and Hispanic men in their early to mid-20s. No arrests have been made in the incident.The vehicle was described as a white or light-colored, late model, four-door sedan. Anyone with information should call Detective Aguirre at 925-809-7726 or Detective Folena at 925-809-7743.Contact Erin Ivie at Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"

Tom Hansen said that after the verbal exchange, the suspects drove by again and fired multiple rounds, striking the four boys.All were taken to area hospitals to be treated for their wounds, which were serious but not life-threatening.Hansen said that while the exchange about the clothing leads police to believe the shooting may have been gang-motivated, investigators have no reason to think any of the victims are involved with a gang.“There was some conversation between the victims and the suspects.  Some of the words the suspects used leads us to believe that it could have gang motivated,” Brentwood Police Department Captain Tom Hanson told KCBS.“However, we have no reason to believe that the victims are engaged in gang activity, affiliated, or gang members at all,” said Hanson.He said that although Brentwood is “not immune” to gang activity, it is rare in the town of about 52,000.“This is something that doesn’t happen often in Brentwood, so obviously we’re shocked and we’re going to work diligently to identify who did this,” Hansen said.An investigation into the shooting is under way and police are attempting to identify witnesses that might lead them to the suspects.A description of the suspects was not immediately available.

33,492151,"Seven people – including a 15-year-old boy who was killed – were shot in West Baltimore on Saturday night, and police believe it stemmed from a conflict over an illegal dice game.The 15-year-old victim was not identified late Saturday, and police said they did not yet know whether he was the intended target. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said this year authorities have seen a rise in ""cluster"" shootings in which multiple victims are struck by gunfire, and they are investigating whether there is a cause for the rise in cluster shootings.Overall, shootings in Baltimore are up this year over last by double-digit figures, though Batts said the number of shooting incidents is about the same as it was last year. He called Saturday's shooting ""outrageous.""The shooting happened around 9:15 p.m. in the 1500 block of W. Fayette St., police said. The other six victims, all adults, and were expected to survive their injures, with a couple of them running to flag down police a couple of blocks away and others taking themselves to a hospital.""We have to modify our behavior,"" said Batts, referring to the citizenry and explaining that police cannot be stationed on every block. ""This is not how you deal with conflict.""Batts said police were still unsure how the conflict over the dice game began but that typically in such incidents, someone tries to rob another player.Along one side of the trash-strewn street, police placed more than a dozen evidence markers over potential shell casings, with that evidence spread out over a half-block.<em><a href=""mailto:cwells@baltsun.com"">cwells@baltsun.com</a></em><em>twitter.com/cwellssun</em>"
34,492151,"BALTIMORE (WJZ) — The investigation continues into who shot seven people in West Baltimore, killing a 15-year-old boy.<strong>Rochelle Ritchie</strong>That 15-year-old who was shot and killed would have been going to school Monday. But instead, his family is planning to bury him.Baltimore City streets are filled with gunfire as police investigate another shooting. This one–injuring six and killing another– happened Saturday night in the 1500-block of W. Fayette Street.“I think to hear seven people shot in a cluster is outrageous for this city. And it’s unacceptable for us as a whole,” said Commissioner Anthony Batts, Baltimore City Police.Deshaun Jones–just 15 years-old and set to start at Frederick Douglass High School this week — was shot and killed.“I seen him laying there fighting for his life,” a woman said.Balloons and a stuffed animal are now left to show condolences for the life lost. Those living across the street are still overwhelmed with emotion.Police believe the shooting started over an illegal game of dice.“He was a young child. Nobody’s life deserves to be taken,” a woman said.There are no confirmed reports that Jones was part of the game, or the intended target.“Some of the other six victims, non-fatal victims, have had police histories. They have come in contact with us at different times. We know at least one of the victims has been shot prior,” Batts said.The violence that has triggered across West Baltimore has residents sick to their stomachs. They’re begging the criminals to put the guns down.Shootings in Baltimore have seen a frightening increase into the double digits. The extra police officers on the streets are not enough to bring comfort to those in the middle of a war zone.“Everybody just needs to get together. Police, everybody,” a woman said.Just this week, Baltimore City Police added an extra 150 officers to the streets.No arrests have been made in the shooting.Who gave these vibrant children of color guns?Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:

© 2018 A Springfield man was killed and three men were injured in a shooting at the Nite Owl Tavern late Saturday, according to police, who did not have anyone in custody Sunday night.Ernest Edwards, 34, was pronounced dead at the scene inside the bar, officials said.Three Springfield men — Anthony Clark, 28; Joshua Clay, 23; and Richard Arnold, 29 — were taken in private vehicles to Springfield Regional Medical Center, where they were treated for gunshot related injuries, police said.Because victims were taken by private vehicles to the hospital, several officers responded there to provide additional security as they investigated what had happened.Clark and Arnold had been treated and released by Sunday afternoon.“Mr. Clay was stabilized at Springfield Medical Center and then transferred to Miami Valley,” said Sgt. David Emmel of the Springfield Police Division.Clay was transported to Miami Valley Hospital by CareFlight. A hospital official declined to release information on his condition because of a request by Clay.Investigators have not identified a suspect nor determined a motive in the shooting at this time, Emmel said.Springfield officers were dispatched to the Nite Owl Tavern, 601 West Main St., around 11:55 p.m. after receiving calls related to the shooting.“Looks like there was a possible fight, a man walked out the door and possibly had a gun,” Emmel said.Police also received subsequent calls about possible shots fired in or near the bar.One victim told police he was leaving the bar when two unknown people outside began to fire shots toward the tavern.“I don’t know if he saw them before or after the shots were fired inside the bar,” Emmel said.Another victim reported he was involved in an “altercation” with another man inside the bar who displayed a gun and fired shots.A third victim told police he was playing pool when he saw another man pulled out a gun. The victim said he was shot while attempting to leave the tavern.The Nite Owl Tavern has been on the Springfield Police Division’s list of bars with the highest number of calls for service. The tavern had a total of 218 calls for service over a 13-year period starting in 1997.In July 2000, a Springfield police officer was shot and seriously injured in the tavern’s parking lot during a traffic stop.© 2018 "

Seeing the stranger accused of killing her husband at the Nite Owl Bar, Alicia Edwards said she wanted to look into his eyes.But at his arraignment Monday, he never glanced her way.“He wouldn’t look at me, not at all,” she said. “It was harder than I actually expected it to be, just to have to sit there and not say anything (and) just have to look at him.”Julian A. Johnson, 29, of Dayton, was arrested Friday at an apartment complex in Trotwood by U.S. Marshals. He’s been charged with one count each of murder and having a weapon under disability and is accused of killing 34-year-old Ernest Edwards at the Nite Owl, 601 W. Main St., on Jan. 26.Johnson pleaded not guilty and asked for a public defender during his arraignment Monday. His bond was set at $510,000.Clark County Assistant Prosecutor Greg Morris indicated his office intends to indict Johnson and plans to present the case to a Clark County grand jury next week.Police are still looking for a second shooter at the Nite Owl bar. A warrant on a complicity to commit murder charge has been issued for Walter Baker Jr. Anyone with information about Baker or the shooting is asked to call the Springfield Police Division at 937-324-7716.Edwards was trying to exit the rear door of the bar after a fight broke out. A Springfield police report alleges Johnson went out the front door, retrieved a semi-automatic handgun from his car and began firing at the back door, reportedly killing Edwards and injuring three others.His widow said Monday it’s devastating to know her husband’s decision to play pool that night cost him his life.“My son is 10 years old,” Alicia Edwards said. “He will never see his father again.”Edwards’ family sat in the front row during Johnson’s arraignment in Clark County Municipal Court on Monday, wearing T-shirts in memory of the man they lost.Alicia Edwards said her family members have fasted every Thursday and prayed daily for police to make an arrest in the case. When she received the news Friday, she said she was “screaming and hollering and thanking God.”

</span>Julian A. Johnson, who took a plea deal Monday, faced the possibility of life in prison if he was convicted of single counts of murder and having a weapon under disability. Instead, Johnson agreed to charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence.Ernest Edwards of Springfield, was shot Jan. 26, 2013, at the Nite Owl, 601 W. Main St. Three others were injured in the shooting.Daniel Driscoll, Clark County assistant prosecutor, said he felt the agreement was the best because of problems with witnesses.""I believe if witnesses had been more cooperative at the scene and if witnesses had been more forthcoming as we prepared for trial, we could have ended up with a larger amount of time for this individual,"" Driscoll said. ""However, I am satisfied with what we got considering what we were dealing with as we prepared for trial.""Edwards, 34, was trying to exit the rear door of the bar after a fight broke out. According to a Springfield police report, Johnson went out the front door, retrieved a semiautomatic handgun from his car and began firing at the back door, reportedly killing Edwards and injuring three others.He was hit multiple times, including the chest.Johnson was taken into custody in March by U.S. Marshals at an apartment complex in Trotwood, where authorities found him hiding in a bathroom.""I think we got a good deal. I think that we served the purpose of putting someone who committed a crime behind bars for a long period of time,"" Driscoll said. He said that he talked last week and again Monday with Edwards' family to explain the plea agreement.""We met with the family, and the family is on board with the plea deal we did today. So, in that respect, I am very satisfied with what happened,"" Driscoll said.Edwards is survived by his wife, Alicia, and a son, now 11.Johnson's lawyers late last week asked for a continuance. But when testimony was scheduled to begin Monday, the plea bargain was announced.EM-dummyText [Insert Text here]<strong>© 2018 <a href=""http://www.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank"">Cox Media Group</a>.</strong>By using this website, you accept the terms of ourThis station is part of Cox Media Group Television.Learn about"

</span>Julian Anwar Johnson was taken into custody by U.S. Marshals at an apartment complex in Trotwood, a Dayton suburb, where authorities found him hiding in a bathroom.Johnson’s arrest comes nearly a month after Ernest Edwards, 34, of Springfield, and three others were shot at the Nite Owl bar, 601 W. Main St., after a fight broke out and someone started shooting.Edwards was pronounced dead at the scene. Two victims were treated for gunshot wounds and later released from Springfield Regional Medical Center. The third victim was hospitalized and continues to suffer from a medical condition.The other victims were men, ages 23, 29 and 29, police said.Springfield Police Sgt. Jeffrey Flores said Edwards was shot multiple times, including the chest, as he left the bar.“This guy was actually a true victim. He was not involved in the fight. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Flores said.Detectives believe the shooting started because of an argument about 11:55 p.m. over a woman, according to police reports.During the melee, one person was seen with a gun and another got hit in the head with a bottle, police said.As employees attempted to clear the building, some people ran out the front door as others attempted to exit out the back, officers said.Johnson allegedly ran out the front door, went to a vehicle, retrieved a semi-automatic handgun and began firing towards the back door where several people, including Edwards, were attempting to exit the club.Police also have a warrant for the arrest of Walter Baker Jr., 28, of Dayton, who they say brandished a gun inside the bar. Investigators believe Johnson was with Baker.“We believe Johnson is the shooter who fired the fatal shot,” Flores said.Police identified Johnson as a suspect several days after the shooting but were unable to locate him, according to police reports.A warrant was issued for his arrest in February, and he was apprehended Friday morning by the Southern Ohio Fugitive Apprehension Strike Team at the Castlebrook Apartments in Trotwood.Johnson is being held in the Clark County Jail. He is charged with murder and having weapons as a felon.He is scheduled to be arraigned in Clark County Municipal Court on Monday.EM-dummyText [Insert Text here]<strong>© 2018 <a href=""http://www.coxmediagroup.com"" target=""_blank"">Cox Media Group</a>.</strong>By using this website, you accept the terms of ourThis station is part of Cox Media Group Television.Learn about"

Matusiewicz, 68</a><b>STORY: </b><b>STORY: </b>Killed was Christine Belford, 39, of Pike Creek, Del. She once was married to the shooter's son, David, who at one time was a well known Newark, Del., optometrist. Belford and David Matusiewicz battled for custody after their 2006 divorce, and David absconded with the girls and his mother to Central America for 18 months.Both were at the courthouse for a child support hearing.""It's a terrible tragedy,"" said Carolyn Belford, who is married to the slain woman's father, Jim Belford. She spoke by telephone while leaving the hospital.The other victim, gunned down in the lobby, was identified by law enforcement sources as Laura Elizabeth ""Beth"" Mulford, a friend of Belford's who was accompanying her for moral support.Two Capitol police officers, both wearing bulletproof vests, took bullets to the chest, but were treated and released from Christiana Hospital by midday, police said. ""Both of them are doing well,"" Lt. Gov. Matt Denn said.Police identified one officer as Steven Rinehart, a retired New Castle County police officer, and sources identified the other officer as Michael Manley.<strong>The background</strong>David Matusiewicz, 45, who was released from federal prison in Texas last year after being convicted in Delaware of kidnapping and bank fraud, was at the courthouse Monday for a child support hearing involving his ex-wife and their three daughters, ages 11, 10 and 7, law enforcement sources said. He went inside the courthouse, where he was taken into custody, said the sources, who added that he was being questioned Monday night.Christine Belford, who had worked as a contact lens technician, told The News Journal in December that she and David Matusiciewiz, whose parental rights were terminated, were still battling in court about overdue child support. ""Kids are doing OK,"" she wrote to the newspaper. ""Some lingering issues, as expected, for all of us.""Besides her three daughters with Matusiewicz, Belford also had a teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Neighbors said Belford feared the Matusiewicz family and also had installed security and surveillance for protection.The elder Matusiewicz once owned a home near Smyrna, Del., with his wife, Lenore, but records show they had moved to Texas.The couple, who have property in Hidalgo County, Texas, declared bankruptcy there in 2011. In their bankruptcy petition, they claimed to own at least one 9 mm pistol and 100 rounds of ammunition.Lenore Matusiewicz, 68, was convicted in Delaware Superior Court of helping their son kidnap the girls and take them on an 18-month odyssey to Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico and Nicaragua. In March, after an international manhunt, authorities found David and Lenore Matusiewicz and the children, one of whom is autistic, living in a dirty and cramped trailer.Lenore Matusiewicz, 67, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for three counts of child endangerment. At her sentencing, her son sat in the back of courtroom, where he said nothing but was visibly angry.She and her son left with the girls in an $80,000 motor home after telling Christine Belford they were taking the kids to Florida for a vacation at Disney World. They never returned, and the kidnapping drew national media attention. The case was featured on the television series ""America's Most Wanted,"" and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's website.Thomas Matusiewicz had contacted The News Journal twice in 2009, while his son's case was winding through the courts, to complain about the one-sided account being portrayed in the media.He said his son, who was then being held in the Salem County, N.J., jail, wanted to be interviewed about the case. David Matusiewicz, however, later denied a reporter's request for an interview.He defended his son as a good father and optometrist who treated ""his patients very well."" Taking the children out of the country, he said, was done to ""protect his children.""<strong>The shootings</strong>Thomas Matusiewicz opened fire shortly before 8 a.m. as employees, attorneys, prospective jurors and people with court hearings were streaming into the New Castle County Courthouse, authorities said.Shots were fired at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Del. on February 11, according to reports from the scene, and several injuries are reported but not confirmed.He entered from the side door, adjacent to the parking garage, and began firing a handgun after passing through the revolving doors that open to the lobby, killing Belford and her friend.Matusiewicz exchanged fire with Capitol police, striking two unidentified officers before he reached the security checkpoint or metal detectors. Although authorities would not say who shot him, they said Matusiewicz died inside the lobby.Moments before the shooting, Chick Chinski, 62, who was reporting for jury duty, said he had ridden the garage elevator to the ground level with the gunman, who wore a Timberline jacket and carried a satchel. Upon going through the revolving doors, he turned around and saw the man holding a gun.""I just saw him walk in, point the gun and I heard the shots. The women went down,"" he said. ""I saw the cop hit the floor, then I hit the floor, then everybody else was going down. There was maybe 50, 60 people in the lobby.""Chinski said he saw an exchange between Capitol police and the gunman and watched the glass on the lobby door shatter. Chinski said he was standing about 50 feet from the women who were killed, adding it was clear they were the intended target.""He just seemed like he came right after them,"" Chinski said. ""When he come in the door that's exactly what he did. Instantly.""Thomas Warren of New Castle, Del., who also was reporting for jury duty, saw a body on the ground outside the entrance. Police arrived in droves, Warren said, and one ordered him and several others back into the garage.<iframe align=""left"" frameborder=""0"" height=""320"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""http://www.mapquest.com/embed?icid=mqdist_mb_tools&amp;c=8Sma&amp;maptype=map&amp;zm=7&amp;cr=39.35968838195183,-75.11588003907984&amp;projection=sm&amp;showScale=false"" style=""padding-right: 30px;"" width=""180""><!--iframe--></iframe>He watched as police threw a sheet over the body and emergency responders took four people out on stretchers. He said they were ""desperately performing CPR"" on a woman and a police officer.""We didn't know if the gunman was still on the loose,"" he said. ""People didn't know what was going on. They just wanted to get the hell out of there.""County, city and state police rushed to the courthouse, along with Mayor Dennis Williams, as employees were ushered out of the building. Police Chief Christine Dunning remained in Philadelphia, where she was participating in an anti-violence roundtable with Vice President Joe Biden.At Belford's home Monday in Meadowdale, neighbors were stunned to learn that she had been killed, but noted that she had installed security and surveillance cameras because she feared retaliation from the Matusiewicz family. Neighbors also said she had hired a private detective who told Belford someone might have been rummaging through her mail.""Many people have a little bit of security, but not as much as she had,"" neighbor Bob Thomas said.Added neighbor Lois Dawson: ""She had all the windows changed with special locks. She had cameras around the house. She had two huge dogs. She didn't know whether she should get a gun. … Her house is like Fort Knox, so I thought she was safe.""<strong>Praise for the officers</strong>As authorities began piecing together what happened, Attorney General Beau Biden urged anyone who witnessed the gunfire and needs counseling or other services to call state police at 1-800 VICTIM1.Biden also applauded the police officers, saying that because of their bravery, ""a greater tragedy was averted."" He also said the courthouse would be closed Tuesday.Gov. Jack Markell, who was traveling in Bangalore, India when he learned of the shooting, will cut off his trip early, arriving back in Delaware on Thursday instead of Saturday.In an interview from India, at nearly 2:30 a.m. local time, Markell said he made the decision to return home early after speaking by phone with the two officers wounded in Monday's shooting.""Obviously I want to express my deepest condolences to the victims,"" Markell said. ""Thank God they're both doing OK.""<i>Contributing: Esteban Parra, Sean O'Sullivan, Adam Taylor, Mike Chalmers, Wade Malcolm, Nichole Dobo, Robin Brown and Jonathan Starkey, The (Wilmington, Del.)

76,480327,"As the New Castle County Courthouse in Delaware remained partially closed Wednesday, two days after a gunman killed two people and then himself inside its lobby, the gunman's daughter told a local paper she thinks his deteriorating health played a role in the shooting.Thomas Matusiewicz, 68, knew his ex-daughter-in-law Christine Belford would be in court Monday for a child support hearing and had staked out a spot in the lobby, police said. When she walked in, he shot her at close range using a .45-caliber handgun. Matusiewicz’s spray of bullets also killed Laura Mulford -- a neighbor who had accompanied Belford -- and injured two capitol police officers. He then turned the gun on himself.But Matusiewicz's daughter, Amy Gonzalez, told the (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal that her “I know he was trying to do what was best for the family,” she said Wednesday. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t the right way.”According to court documents and an FBI statement, the Matusiewicz family had a years-long, tumultuous relationship with Belford.In August 2007, Matusiewicz’s wife, Lenore, and son, David, who was married to Belford for almost five years, loaded David's three young daughters into a motor home, telling Belford the girls were going on a two-week trip to Walt Disney World. Instead, they embarked on a 19-month journey through Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica and As the international search entered its 11th month, “America’s Most Wanted” featured the family’s saga. Then, in March 2009, a deputy U.S. marshal arrested David Matusiewicz in Nicaragua, where they also found a cache of fake Social Security cards and passports for him and his daughters.Six months later he pleaded guilty to bank fraud and international parental kidnapping and was eventually sentenced to four years in prison and five years of probation, court documents show.“He robbed the children of 19 months of a normal, healthy childhood and exposed them to continuing psychological harm,” David Weiss, U.S attorneyLenore Matusiewicz pleaded guilty to endangering the girls' welfare and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay for family counseling,David Matusiewicz, who was released from federal prison in Texas in September, violated parole by not paying child support and court fees, according to a document filed in federal court on Tuesday. Matusiewicz, who is back in federal custody, made an initial court appearance Tuesday, Kimberlynn Reeves, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Wilmington, told <strong>ALSO:</strong><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-seal-osama-bin-laden-shooter-esquire-20130212,0,2059823.story"">Esquire story on Bin Laden's killer stirs confusion</a><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-medal-of-honor-afghanistan-20130211,0,180406.story"">Former Californian Clint Romesha receives Medal of Honor</a><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-chris-kyle-sniper-memorial-20130211,0,1538204.story"">SEAL sniper Chris Kyle gets public farewell at Cowboys Stadium</a><em>marisa.gerber@latimes.com</em>"

79,480327,"Christine Belford had endured a bitter divorce and custody dispute, and she was living in fear that her relationship with her ex-husband would take a violent turn.That fear became a shocking reality Monday, when her ex-father-in-law, Thomas Matusiewicz, 68, opened fire in the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, killing her and another woman, and wounding two law enforcement officers before killing himself, state police said.It was the tragic fallout of the deeply troubled relationship between Belford, 39, and David Matusiewicz, 45, officials said.In 2007, David Matusiewicz kidnapped their three young daughters from Newark, Del., and fled to Central America, where they were found 19 months later, living in a cramped and filthy trailer.David Matusiewicz was sentenced to four years in prison on charges of kidnapping and bank fraud, but was released on probation in September.Belford had told neighbors to watch her house for suspicious activity. She had a security camera installed after she suspected someone had been going through her mail and looking in the windows, neighbor Lois Dawson said.“It’s Fort Knox over there,” said Dawson, 66.Belford recently told Dawson that Matusiewicz was coming up from Texas, where he was living with his parents about 20 miles from the Mexican border.“I know she was afraid of him and his family,” Dawson said.Matusiewicz and Belford were due in court Monday for a child-support hearing.When Belford walked into the courthouse lobby, Thomas Matusiewicz walked up to her and shot her in the chest with a .45-caliber handgun, according to Delaware state police. Laura “Beth” Mulford, a friend who was with Belford, turned to run but was gunned down as well.Thomas Matusiewicz then exchanged gunfire with Capitol Police, eventually falling dead near the revolving doors with a gunshot in the upper body and a self-inflicted shot to the head, state police said.Two Capitol Police officers were shot in the chest but were saved by their bulletproof vests.All the while, David Matusiewicz was inside the courthouse, past the security checkpoint. He and his father had entered the courthouse together, state police said, but his father had waited in the lobby about 35 minutes for Belford to arrive.Police questioned David Matusiewicz and arrested him for alleged probation violations.According to the probation officer’s filing in federal court Tuesday, Matusiewicz had obtained permission to travel from Texas to Delaware for the hearing, and said he would stay with his uncle in Bayville, N.J. But the night before the shooting, he stayed in Elkton, Md., without permission, according to the filing.Matusiewicz had defaulted on his $2,200 monthly child support payments and owed $9,674 in restitution, according to the filing.Bernard August, 61, said the shooting was a blow to the Newark community of Meadowdale, where Belford and Mulford lived.August said the women were longtime friends whose daughters played together. He described Mulford, a nurse and mother of two, as a “caring and loving person.”“It is hard to put into words what has happened here,” August said. “We all suffer the losses of the people in our communities.”Belford’s disputes ere not only with her ex-husband, but with his parents and sister as well.David Matusiewicz spent more than a year planning the abduction of the girls, prosecutors said. He forged his wife’s name on a loan modification, sent the money to an overseas bank account, and cashed out his successful Newark optometry practice.He and his mother, Lenore, rented a motor home and told Belford they were taking the girls — Laura, 5, Leigh, 4, and Karen, 2 — to Walt Disney World.While on the lam in Costa Rica, Panama, and Nicaragua, David and Lenore told the children that Belford had killed herself, according to records from David Matusiewicz’s criminal trial.The kidnappings sparked national media attention, including a segment on the TV show “America’s Most Wanted.”When the children were found and returned to their mother, Laura was suffering from post-traumatic stress and Leigh — who is autistic and has difficulty communicating — “was in great pain from abscessed teeth,” according to court records.Lenore Matusiewicz was sentenced to 18 months in prison.In 2009, Belford filed a personal injury lawsuit against her ex-husband, his parents, and his sister Amy.Lenore and Thomas Matusiewicz filed for bankruptcy in 2011, naming Belford as a creditor.On the day he was sentenced, David Matusiewicz apologized to his ex-wife and his daughters “for the trauma they have been put through.” He vowed to “rededicate myself to helping people” and supporting his daughters.If the judge would grant leniency, Matusiewicz said, “you will never have an opportunity to see me back in a courtroom.”Matusiewicz’s probation hearing is scheduled for Friday.<hr/><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"">Contact Jessica Parks at 610-313-8117; <a href=""mailto:jparks@philly.com"">jparks@philly.com,</a> or @JS_Parks on Twitter.</span>

In exchange for his testimony against the accused killer, Davis Fotu is sentenced to serve three years in jail, and three years on probation. With tears in his eyes, Fotu apologized to the victims' family members, but did they believe it was heartfelt?""I'm sorry for even being there,” Fotu said. “It took me a year to find out what happened in that living room, and I'm all over the news about testifying. They asked me, ‘Are you telling?’ and I'm like, ‘Yeah, I'm telling; he killed three people for nothing.’""He was referring to the man accused of being a cold-blooded murderer: David Fresques, who’s headed to trial for allegedly gunning down three people in a Midvale home last year. The victims were Omar Jarman, Shontay Young and Danielle Lucero. Vicky Myers was also shot in the chest but survived.Fotu will now serve jail time for obstruction of justice. The plea deal is so Fotu will testify against Fresques. In court, he turned around to address family who lost loved ones during the senseless act of violence.""I'm so sorry for even being there,” Fotu said. “I will do whatever. I will carry that cross until he's convicted. I'm sorry.”""Do I believe we've heard the whole truth? No, but I think we've got enough that I'm just grateful that he made the choice that he did,"" said Cathy Candelaria, who is Omar Jarman's sister.The family of all three victims said closure won't come until justice is served, and even then their wounds will take a long time to heal.""I'm very sad today, happy that this thing is finally moving on,” Andy Lucero said after Fotu was sentenced. “Two down, one to go. I know I'm sad. I don't have the words. Let's hope everything, let’s hope that the state of Utah will be able to prosecute this guy because he's the menace of society, always has been and always will be.”""Once the trial is done and over with, that will be my sense of closure,” said Shontay Young’s brother, Sean Young. “We are taking little steps to try and get there.”David Fresques pleaded not guilty to the aggravated murder charges he's facing.

84,480358,"The first victim of the swift-moving shooting spree that terrorized southern California Tuesday and claimed four lives was an aspiring actress whose connection to the gunman was not immediately clear, authorities said Wednesday.Courtney Aoki, 20, was shot multiple times and left for dead around 4:45 a.m. Tuesday in the residence that shotgun-wielding madman Ali Syed shared with his parents, police said.Cops said they couldn't confirm a report Aoki worked as a stripper.""We're still trying to figure out their relationship,"" Gail Krause, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff told the Daily News. ""We have not identified an occupation (for Aoki).""Syed, an unemployed part-time community college student who committed suicide after his bloody hour-long rampage, was a loner, cops said.""He spent a lot of time alone in his room playing video games,"" Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.Amormino said the suspect left ""no evidence, no note, nothing that would explain this very bizarre, violent behavior.""Syed's one-man crime wave started in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday with a 12-gauge shotgun purchased by his father, cops said.The gunman killed Aoki in cold blood and then fled the family's Ladera Ranch residence as his parents called 911, authorities said.He killed two more people during carjackings, injured at least three more with wild, random shooting along his 25- mile trail of carnage and ultimately shot himself in the head when cornered by California Highway Patrol, authorities said.His other two murder victims were a beloved father of two and young plumber known for his easy smile.Victim Melvin Edwards, 69, was apparently picked at random for his white BMW as he waited at a stop sign in Santa Ana, Calif., authorities said.Syed ordered Edwards out of his vehicle at gunpoint, marched him to a curb and shot him three times execution-style, witnesses told police.""The family is still processing the shock and grief of the whole event,"" Edwards' brother-in-law Jeff Osborn told the Daily News Wednesday. ""He was a great dad and a great friend.""In a statement from the family, Edwards was described as an avid Dodgers fan and accomplished fly fisherman.The Laguna Hills resident also was a Vietnam vet who ran a small aerospace machinery company with his son Ryan, 36.""He was a devoted husband, father and grandfather and was always generous with his time and heart,"" the statement said. ""He carried himself with great dignity and civility, and lived by example.""Syed claimed his last victim, 26-year-old plumber Jeremy Lewis, in a parking lot near a hotel construction site in Tustin.The plumbing project's foreman ran toward the shooting to intervene and came face to face with Syed, who purportedly made cryptic comments about the drug industry, the foreman told KNBC.""He said this was a result of the drug industry, the narcotics industry, and that it didn't matter because he'd be dead in 20 minutes,"" foreman Shane Caporaso said. ""I just started running and got lucky.""Syed shot at Caporaso twice, hitting him once in the arm, KNBC reported.He described Lewis as always smiling and joking.""Everybody's missing Jeremy,"" Caporaso said.After allegedly killing Lewis, Syed took one of the construction trucks and fled to nearby Orange, this time with California Highway Patrol officers in pursuit.He jumped from the moving utility truck at an intersection in Orange around 5:55 a.m. and shot himself in the head, police said.""There really wasn't a confrontation at the very end,"" Tustin Police Chief Scott Jordan said. ""It happened so quickly.""A shotgun was recovered at the scene and is believed to be the only weapon used.Syed had no criminal record.Syed's parents told police they did not know the young woman killed inside their home.""Our son lives with us and I think they got into a fight or something and we heard a gunshot,"" his dad told a 911 dispatcher in a call released Wednesday. ""My son is younger, he sometimes has friends over. I don't know all the details at this point.""The dad said the son fled the house soon after the shots were fired.""We were asleep, we heard something, it sounded like a gunshot,"" the dad said.

The victim's identity and relationship to the gunman -- a student at Saddleback College -- were not available Tuesday night, but Amormino said she is not Syed's mother.""It's not known at this time what she was doing in the residence,"" Amormino said.Responding deputies were notified the gunman left the residence in his parents' black sport utility vehicle.The police response in the Tustin area -- about 20 miles north of Ladera Ranch -- began with a carjacking and shots fired report at about 5:10 a.m. near Red Hill and Nisson Road, just off the 5 Freeway. A man was waiting in a vehicle in a Denny's parking lot when he noticed Syed loading a shotgun.""(The victim) quickly got back into his car and accelerated rapidly,"" said Tustin Police Chief Scott Jordan.

Three motorists reported injuries after Syed opened fire at vehicles on the freeway, police said.Syed returned to the pickup and drove to the Village Way exit in Santa Ana, where a second carjacking and occurred. The carjacking victim was killed in what police described as an execution.""He confronted our victim, who was in his BMW, and ordered him out of the vehicle,"" said Santa Ana Police Corporal Anthony Bertagna. ""He walks him to the side of the curb and executes our victim.""Aerial video showed a pickup and several patrol vehicles on the exit ramp from the 55 Freeway. The victim was shot three times, Jordan said.The shooting victim was identified as Melvin Edwards, 69, of Laguna Hills. Edwards was on his way to work in Santa Ana, said Santa Ana Police Chief Carlos Rojas.The gunman drove to a nearby Micro Center electronics store parking lot near Edinger Avenue and Newport Avenue in the victim's BMW, then carjacked another driver, police said. Officers discovered two gunshot victims at the Micro Center, one of whom was pronounced dead at the scene just east of the 55 Freeway.The deceased victim was identified as Jeremy Lewis, 27, of Fullerton.Colleagues told NBC4 the victims at the Micro Center lot worked for a plumbing contractor in Rancho Cucamonga. Lewis was shot and killed just as he was arriving for work at a hotel near the Micro Center. Lewis' co-worker suffered a graze wound to the arm when he responded to the gunfire. ""It was his vehicle that Mr. Syed then entered,"" Jordan said. ""Many calls were coming in and the California Highway Patrol got in behind the stolen vehicle.""The quickly developing situation came to an end in Orange, when Syed exited onto eastbound Katella Avenue. Syed ""almost instantly"" shot himself in the head when he got out of the moving vehicle, Jordan said.A shotgun was recovered at the location, Amormino said.<strong><em>Follow NBCLA for the latest LA news, events and entertainment:</em></strong>"

Tulsa Police, Fire and EMSA responded just after 9 p.m. Thursday, February 21, 2013, to the apartments in the 1200 block of North 89th East Avenue.Police say four Spartan College students were shot, both inside an apartment and in the parking lot.EMSA says one victim, Chaz Fain, 18, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police say he is Tulsa&apos;s 15th homicide of the year.Three other men, two 18-year-olds and one 19-year-old, are in serious condition at area hospitals, EMSA says.The majority of the residents at Spartan Landing Apartments, just behind Spartan College of Aeronautics, near Pine and Memorial, are Spartan students.Police arrested 41-year-old Mark Hopkins at a nearby business complex at around 10:30 p.m.  They said the weapon was not recovered.Police say Hopkins&apos; hands were injured from climbing fences. Tulsa Police Sergeant Dave Walker credits Hopkins&apos; apprehension to the patrol officer&apos;s quick response. He also said several citizens called in to report suspicious activity in the area of the murder which led to officers observing Hopkins in the parking lot at 9900 East Admiral less than an hour and a half after the shooting.  A News On 6 crew was there as police and EMSA loaded Hopkins into an ambulance to receive medical treatment before being brought downtown.Police think Hopkins is acquainted with the victims and may also be a student.Hopkins was booked into the Tulsa County jail on one complaint of first degree murder and three complaints of shooting with intent to kill."

Dave Walker of TPD says they don't know Hopkins' motive for the shootings.All five men knew one another from attending classes at the Spartan School of Aeronautics, located just north of the apartment complex.Residents there tell KRMG only students of the school live at Spartan Landing.Hopkins and two of the surviving victims lived in the apartment where the shootings occurred.Fain and the other surviving victim also lived in the complex, but not in that apartment, Walker tells KRMG.Police say Hopkins came to Tulsa from Alabama, Fain from Florida.The Spartan School attracts students from around the world.There are no comments yet.

            By <a href=""mailto:Bdeiters@mlive.com"" id=""byline__authorEmailLink"" title=""Email Barton Deiters"">Bdeiters@mlive.com</a>GRAND RAPIDS, MI – In what was likely the last shooting near the New Roosevelt Bar, a 28-year-old man is looking at decades in prison after he was convicted of shooting five people outside the now-closed tavern in February 2013.A Kent County Circuit Court jury found Marcus Antoine Smith guilty of attempted murder and four counts of assault with intent to go great bodily harm onThursday, Dec. 11, after a three-day trial.The shootings took place outside the former bar at 1447 Grandville Ave. SW inA security guard who was shot and other witnesses told the jury that Smith fired shots at a group of people gathered outside the back door of the bar.Eric Jones testified that Smith looked right at him as he fired the shots that ended up forcing the security guard to undergo numerous surgeries and use a brace in order to walk.Jones is the victim in the attempted murder charge. The other victims suffered injuries that were not life-threatening.<strong>Related:</strong>The bar earned its reputation over the years as a regular destination for police investigating illegal acts <a href=""http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/03/new_roosevelt_bar_where_4_were.html"">The bar shut down in March of 2013, </a>Smith was on the run for nearly a year before he was finally arrested in Grand Rapids.Smith turned down a plea offer from the Kent County Prosecutor’s Office that would have dismissed two of the assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder charges. It also would not have called for Smith to be sentenced as a repeat offender.Smith has a massive criminal record that includes numerous minor drug offenses, lying to police and driving infractions. He was in jail a week before the shooting occurred on charges of use of marijuana and lying to police in Wyoming, according to Kent County Jail records.As a result of his record, Smith faces a minimum sentence of 19 to 47 years and a maximum of life in prison when he is sentenced before Kent County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Leiber on Jan. 28.Smith seemed unaffected by the jury’s decision Thursday as he was taken from the courtroom to the Kent County Jail, where he will await sentencing.<em>E-mail Barton Deiters: <a href=""mailto:bdeiters@mlive.com"">bdeiters@mlive.com</a> and follow him on Twitter at <a href=""http://twitter.com/GRPBarton"">twitter.com/GRPBarton</a> or Facebook at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/barton.deiters.5"">facebook.com/bartondeiters.5</a></em><a href=""https://members.mlive.com/index.aspx?siteCode=MI"">Newspaper</a>

            By GRAND RAPIDS, MI – A hearing on non-renewal of New Roosevelt’s liquor license has been cancelled due to a settlement between the city and the bar’s owner.Grand Rapids City Commission on Tuesday, March 12, approved a deal that will close the bar at 1447 Grandville Ave. SW immediately. The agreement enables bar owner Rosalia Rivera to keep possession of her Class C liquor license with intent to sell it. Rivera was not immediately available for comment.City Attorney Catherine Mish said the settlement permits Rivera to retain “financial interest in the liquor license, but the city solves the public safety problem that was in existence at that location.”Grand Rapids police and the Roosevelt Park Neighborhood Association sought non-renewal of the bar's liquor license due to violence on the property. Three men and a woman were hit by bullets when someone fired at a back door of the bar where patrons were trying to leave around 2 a.m. Feb. 22. Two men were shot in the leg, another in the foot and a woman was hit in the neck. None of the injuries were life-threatening.In November, 27-year-old Grand Rapids man Wellington Guevara was shot and killed outside the bar at 2 a.m.<strong>RELATED:</strong>The agreement also gives Grand Rapids some additional authority over transfer of the license, if it gets sold for use within the city. For example, Rivera would have to get the city’s pre-approval of any new licensee. The city also may be able to deny approval based on a new licensee's planned hours of operation and amount of food to be sold, relative to alcohol sales.City leaders said the New Roosevelt closing could work similar to transfer of the liquor license once held by <em>Email <a href=""mailto:mvandebu@mlive.com""> Matt Vande Bunte</a>, follow him on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/vandebum"">Twitter</a> or be his friend on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mlivematt.vandebunte"">Facebook</a>.</em><a href=""https://members.mlive.com/index.aspx?siteCode=MI"">Newspaper</a>

    </script>Gallery: New Roosevelt Bar shooting Feb. 22, 2013GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Police at a hearing this week will try to make a case that recent violence at New Roosevelt Bar stems from poor management.The Grand Rapids City Commission at 1 p.m. Tuesday, March 12, will be asked to recommend non-renewal of the Class C liquor license for the bar where a man was killed last year and where four people were shot last month. The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.“After the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,” said Lt. Richard Nawrocki, who commands the police departments vice unit. “Based upon the immediate community’s concerns, we believe it fits the criteria for the City Commission’s review for non-renewal. “We’re going to have to prove that the activities have some correlation to the bar here, and that’s what we will try to show.”<strong>RELATED:</strong>Police say they have had to respond to incidents at 1447 Grandville Ave. SW more often since the bar got its liquor license in March 2012. The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.  <span id=""asset-12387815""><a href=""http://media.mlive.com/grpress/news_impact/other/New Roosevelt Bar.pdf"">The memo</a></span>“We can’t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it’s the parking lot,” she said. “It’s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals. We want crime to stop in the Southwest Side, and I hope that once we close the violence will stop, but they haven’t arrested people in connection to any of the shootings.“They are cutting the tree, but not the root (of the problem).”Julie Niemchick, director of the Roosevelt Park Neighborhood Association, said she sympathizes with Rivera. Still, the neighborhood is tired of the violence and wants the bar to close, she said.“We can’t keep affording to have someone injured or murdered in our neighborhood,” Niemchick said. “We just can’t have that. We can’t tolerate it.“It’s the element that keeps showing up at their door that is the problem. If the bar isn’t open, then obviously there won’t be any violence there.”<iframe frameborder=""0"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""http://www.mapquest.com/embed?hk=XR12gd"" style=""height: 270px; width: 450px;""></iframe><em>MLive reporter Sandra Chang contributed to this report.</em><em>Email <a href=""mailto:mvandebu@mlive.com""> Matt Vande Bunte</a>, follow him on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/vandebum"">Twitter</a> or be his friend on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mlivematt.vandebunte"">Facebook</a>.</em><a href=""https://members.mlive.com/index.aspx?siteCode=MI"">Newspaper</a>

Standing up to influences does.”He described Fletcher as a warm, soft-spoken family man.Additional charges relating to the case were dismissed as part of the plea bargain.Fletcher also was charged with eight counts of aggravated assault stemming from a Feb. 24, 2013, shooting at a “party house” in the 2800 block of Mercer University Drive.Those charges also were dropped.During a Monday hearing, Matson said Fletcher and his brother, 29-year-old Frank Fletcher Jr., were at an alleged Crips gang hangout on Mercer University Drive Feb. 24, 2013, when an argument began.

Rushing is accused of firing the gun that killed James Key, 50, and wounded three other people on Sunday, while Williams is believed to have driven him to the scene of the crime.MOULTRIE — The trial of one of two men accused in a March 2013 drive-by shooting that claimed two lives and injured others is scheduled to begin on Tuesday.Antonio Dewayne Williams, 25, who is accused of driving the car used in the shooting that claimed the lives of James L. Key, 50, and his 42-year-old nephew Eric Debruce, is the first defendant scheduled in the case.Derek Lamar Rushing, 24, is the alleged triggerman in the shooting in which a group of people was sprayed by bullets as they were gathered around a fire in the front yard of 224 Second St. N.W. His trial is scheduled for later.However, in the event of a situation that changes the scenario — such as Williams entering a guilty plea — Rushing’s trial would start on Tuesday.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in the days after the shooting that at least 30 bullets were fired at about 9:50 p.m. on March 3, 2013.Key was pronounced dead at the scene on March 3, while Debruce died March 20 due to complications from being shot multiple times. He was shot twice in the upper body and once in the leg, and part of the leg was amputated while he was hospitalized.Margaret White-Tuff and Elijah Daniels also were struck in the hail of bullets, several of which hit the house next door.An indictment issued in the case charges both Williams and Rushing with two counts each of malice murder, two counts of felony murder, five counts of aggravated assault and nine counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.The GBI has said that Rushing had an argument with someone earlier in the day, and that the shooting was intended to settle a score from that encounter. The intended victim apparently was one of Key’s relatives, who was not at the Second Street residence at the time of the shooting.In addition to ironing out issues in the upcoming trial this week, Superior Court Judge Harry Jay Altman II handed down sentences to two unrelated defendants.Paul Lewis Strickland, 31, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana. He was sentenced to three years in prison and seven years’ probation on the cocaine charge and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. Lewis was also sentenced to a 10-year probation sentence on the marijuana charge that will run concurrent with the other sentence.Altman sentenced Zayvone Tyshaun Brown, 18, to eight years’ probation, $2,000 fine and community service on a plea to one count of felony burglary.Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.<span style=""font-weight:bold"">First Amendment:</span>"

Winds NW at 5 to 10 mph.<small><i class=""fas tnt-info-circle""></i> Updated: October 20, 2018 @ 2:11 pm</small>Moultrie, GeorgiaMOULTRIE — A Colquitt County jury took less than an hour on Wednesday to return not-guilty verdicts on 16 separate counts in a 2013 murder case.Superior Court Judge James E. Hardy ordered the release of Antonio Dewayne Williams following a two-day trial in which a co-defendant reneged on a plea deal that called for him to testify.Williams, 25, had been indicted in an 18-count indictment that included two counts each of felony murder and malice murder. Two of the lesser counts were dismissed for technical reasons before the case went to trial.Williams was accused of taking part in the murders of 50-year-old James L. Key and Key’s nephew Eric Debruce, 42, by driving the shooter to and from the scene.Henry Lee, who attended the trial with his wife Lola, said it was tough to see a man who was involved in his step-son’s and brother-in-law’s slayings walk out of court.“I’m not going to judge him,” said Lola Lee, mother of Debruce and Key’s sister. “I’m going to let God judge him.”Williams was the final witness, testifying in his own behalf. He told jurors that he was not aware that Derek Lamar Rushing, who pleaded guilty in the case in August, planned a mass shooting that night in northwest Moultrie.He said that he gave co-defendant Derek Lamar Rushing a ride in his girlfriend’s Chevrolet Tahoe. Over a period of about an hour he drove Rushing to his residence, where he said someone handed Rushing an AK-47 assault rifle, then to a Fourth Court Northwest residence and later to the 200 block of Second Street Northwest.After parking in a driveway where Rushing directed him, Williams said, he waited while Rushing got out of the car with the gun. Rushing returned to the car after the gunfire and Williams dropped him off with the gun at Rushing’s residence.Rushing, the alleged triggerman, earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the case. Superior Court Judge Harry J. Altman II sentenced him to a 20-year prison sentence on one count and withheld sentencing until the disposition of Williams’ case.As a condition of the plea agreement, Rushing had agreed to testify if Williams went to trial.Prosecutors had argued that Williams was a willing participant March 3, 2013, shooting at 224 Second St. N.W., in which Key, was pronounced dead at the scene. Debruce died on March 20.Margaret White-Tuff and Elijah Daniels, who were also at the residence, also were struck by some of the 32 bullets law enforcement said were fired that night. Bullets also punctured the walls of a house next door, with several passing completely through concrete-block walls. One lodged in an oven after puncturing the walls.The 12 jurors were not allowed to hear of a previous conviction of Williams on aggravated assault and gang charges.Williams pleaded guilty in March 2011 to one count each of party to the crime of aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, according to Dougherty County court records. The indictment charged him with taking part with two other men in a Sept. 13, 2009, assault of another man with a pistol and doing so while associated with the Southside Bloods gang.Williams was banished from Doughtery County as a condition of his sentence at that time.In his closing statement, Quitman attorney Luke Mitchell, who represented Williams, questioned the motive given for his client’s involvement.On Tuesday Patrick McCloud, 32, led to the witness stand in manacles and an orange jump suit, said that he had two run-ins with Williams in the weeks prior to the shooting. During the second incident, he told jurors, he punched Williams and pulled a gun.That incident occurred at the same Fourth Court Northwest residence where Williams said he took Rushing prior to the shooting.Mitchell suggested that March 1 incident between one of Rushing’s brothers and another man known to hang out in the 200 block of Second Street precipitated the shooting.“It’s a hard feeling to swallow,” Henry Lee said during an interview a short time after the trial. “That’s a hard pill to swallow, especially when he admitted being there, having the gun in the car, transporting the gun twice and then taking the gun back to that point (Rushing’s residence). Justice wasn’t done.”He said that the suppression of Williams’ prior violent background to jurors and a lack of lesser charges that they could have considered gave the 10 women and two men only two choices. Jurors would have been more likely to convict Williams based on the available evidence -- which did not point to Williams planning the assault -- as being party to a crime, he said.“Just him driving the car, they either had to convict him on the (murder) charges or release him,” Henry Lee said.For the victim’s family and Rushing the ordeal may not be over. With Rushing’s refusal to testify he is facing the same 18 felony counts on which he was indicted, including the four murder counts as well as five counts of aggravated assault and nine counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.In cases where a co-defendant’s final sentencing depends on his testimony at trial, failing to do so is a deal-breaker, said Senior Superior Court Judge Loring A. Gray Jr. of Dougherty County, who discussed a hypothetical murder case, not the specific case at hand in Colquitt County.“The fact of the matter is, the deal will be off,” he said. “You’d be back to square one.“Once he fails to testify the original charges would (return) and he would again stand charged with murder.”Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.<span style=""font-weight:bold"">First Amendment:</span>"

Two teenagers accused of gunning down an 18-year-old man in Los Banos last month will be tried as adults on murder charges.Defendants Christopher Aguayo, 15, and Albert Hernandez, 17, pleaded not guilty to the murder charges during an arraignment hearing in Merced County Superior Court on Wednesday. Los Banos police arrested the pair in the March 4 shooting death of Shane Thomas Moore.Moore was fatally shot while inside the garage of a La Mesa Lane home with a group of men. Three others sustained non-fatal bullet wounds. Police have said the defendants and some of the victims are documented gang members, but Moore was not.Chief Deputy District Attorney Harold Nutt said the pair are being charged as adults because of the serious nature of the crime. If convicted, both could spend the rest of their lives in prison. ""As an office, we've made the decision that when a firearm is used, especially when someone is killed, were are going to look at (trying the defendants) as adults,"" he said.Hernandez and Aguayo have each been charged with one count of murder, three counts of attempted murder and one count of participation in a criminal street. Those charges include enhancements for alleged use of a gun.The shooting was reported around 9 p.m. March 4. According to police reports, witnesses said some of the victims had been helping someone move into the house. The victims had been gathered in the garage when someone opened fire.Police believe Hernandez was the shooter, while Aguayo acted at the accomplice. Witnesses reported seeing someone hiding behind the vehicle in front of the home when shots rang out.A few weeks after the shooting, police arrested Aguayo. The evidence against Aguayo includes a taped phone conversation where he allegedly made certain statements to his brother, connecting him to the crime, according to police reports.While being questioned by police, Aguayo broke down crying, saying he didn't want to participate in the shooting, and had gotten into an argument with Hernandez prior to the incident.Aguayo said Hernandez rode off on a bike after the argument, and he then heard gunshots. Aguayo also said Hernandez had admitted committing the shooting afterward.Attorney David Capron, who is representing Aguayo, said his client is not guilty. ""He was not involved in this murder or attempted murder,"" Capron said after Wednesday's hearing.Under questioning from detectives, Hernandez initially denied any involvement in the shooting, but later confessed, according to police reports. Hernandez told detectives that killing Moore was accidental, as he was a ""non-gang related"" person. Hernandez did tell detectives, however, that he was aiming at rival gang members -- and he even agreed to write an apology letter to the victim's family.Deputy Public Defender Chris Loethen, who is representing Hernandez, said he's still waiting for some evidence in the case to come back from the Department of Justice. ""At this point, without reviewing the results of those tests, I am not in a position to comment further about the case,"" Loethen said. However, Loethen pointed out none of the witnesses in the case were able to see the shooter's face, and could only describe his clothing. The defendants remain in custody at Merced County Juvenile Hall. City Editor Victor A. Patton can be reached at (209) 385-2431 or vpatton@mercedsun-star.com.

Kimberly Brewer stood before a crowded courtroom Friday morning and said she would never forgive the gang member who opened fire into a crowded garage last year in Los Banos and killed her 18-year-old son, Shane Moore.Brewer described convicted killer Albert Hernandez as a “cold, calculated monster.”“We do not forgive him for killing Shane,” Brewer told the judge. “True justice would be for the court to turn him over to us.”Hernandez, 18, was sentenced Friday to serve 40 years to life in prison for killing Moore on March 4, 2013. A jury convicted him of second-degree murder and gang participation in February after a three-week trial before Judge Ronald W. Hansen. Hernandez was 17 at the time of the attack, but he was charged as an adult.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.The Merced County District Attorney’s Office said Hernandez intended to attack rival gang members but killed Moore, who was not involved in gangs, and injured three others. Hernandez fired at least 10 rounds from a Ruger P89 pistol with an extended magazine into a crowd of about a dozen people, according to trial testimony.An appeal is planned.Co-defendant Christopher Aguayo pleaded guilty on Oct. 2, 2013, to being an accessory in the killing and was sentenced to seven years in the state Division of Juvenile Justice. Aguayo, 16, also was charged as an adult.Prosecutors sought a first-degree murder conviction, but the jury found Hernandez innocent of that charge.Defense attorney Chris Loethen said jurors believed Hernandez shot into a crowd of people but did not intend to kill anyone. Loethen also noted the three other victims were all shot below the waist, which he said was further evidence Hernandez did not intend to kill.Moore’s family rejected the argument and said the jury should have convicted Hernandez of first-degree murder.“The intent (to kill) was there,” Brewer said outside the courtroom Friday. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a good marksman or not.”In his ruling Friday, the judge considered Hernandez’s youth, maturity, and high school records when determining parole eligibility. Hansen said Hernandez’s high school grades showed “some hope,” but were “inconsistent” and noted a history of suspensions.“I cannot overlook the lifestyle he chose. I can’t ignore the fact he killed an innocent person, a person he did not know, a person who did not know him,” Hansen said. “Mr. Hernandez, you have a steep price to pay.”Hansen said Hernandez would not be eligible for his first parole hearing for 25 years, the maximum time allowed for a juvenile by law.Loethen said he respectfully disagreed with the characterization of Hernandez made by both the judge and the victim’s mother. He said he empathized with Brewer’s grief, but said the realities of the case were more complex than labeling his client as “a monster.”“He’s not a monster,” Loethen said. “He was himself victimized (by gangs) and he tried to avoid killing anyone. That’s not a monster. There are reasons why he ended up in that situation.”He described Hernandez as a “shy kid,” with a “warm, nice personality” who got involved with street gangs for protection after he was assaulted by a gang member in San Jose. Loethen described Moore’s death as “a terrible tragedy” for the victim’s family, as well as Hernandez’s family.During the trial, Loethen criticized tactics used by Los Banos police investigators during their interview with Hernandez. Loethen said police exploited Hernandez’s youth and his ignorance of the law and crime scene investigation methods to convince him that he would never see his family again unless he confessed to killing Moore.Prosecutors countered the argument saying detectives used legal, commonly practiced methods of interrogation in their interview and that falsely confessing to a murder “made no sense.”

After deliberating nearly three days, a Merced County jury on Friday convicted a Los Banos gang member of murder in connection with the death of an 18-year-old man last year.Albert Hernandez, 18, was found guilty of second-degree murder and criminal street gang participation. The Merced County District Attorney’s Office had charged Hernandez with first-degree, or premeditated, murder.The jury of nine women and three men also found Hernandez guilty of firearm and weapons enhancements, but not guilty of three counts of attempted murder in connection with the same incidentThe verdict came after a nearly three-week trial before Judge Ronald W. Hansen in Merced Superior Court.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Shane Moore, 18, was shot to death March 4, 2013, at a home in the 800 block of La Mesa Lane in Los Banos. Three other people were injured in the attack.Prosecutors said Hernandez fired 10 rounds from a Ruger P89 pistol with an extended magazine into a crowd of about a dozen people. The group included several people Hernandez believed were rival gang members. Moore was not a gang member and, police said, not the intended target.Thomas Min, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case, said he respected the jury’s verdict, saying, “I’m glad that Shane’s family will have some closure.”Moore’s family attended nearly every day of the trial, but asked for privacy.Co-defendant Christopher Aguayo pleaded guilty Oct. 2, 2013, to being an accessory in the killing and was sentenced to seven years in the state Division of Juvenile Justice. Aguayo, 16, was charged as an adult.Hernandez’s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Chris Loethen, said that based on the conviction, the jury believed the defendant fired into a crowd of people, but did not intend to kill anyone.“But firing into a crowd is such an incredibly dangerous action that is likely to produce death or great bodily injury. That’s what this (verdict) indicates,” Loethen said after the verdict was read. “I’m thankful for the not guilty verdicts and the time and the effort and thought they (the jurors) put into this verdict.”Jurors could not be reached for comment Friday.Loethen said an appeal is planned, and he intends to speak with  Hernandez regarding a possible motion for a new trial.Hansen ordered  Hernandez to return to court March 28 for sentencing. The maximum possible prison sentence was not clear Friday.During the trial both attorneys focused heavily on Hernandez’s interview with Los Banos police detectives nearly three weeks after Moore’s death. With no physical evidence in the case, Hernandez’s statement was the key piece of evidence.Prosecutors said Hernandez confessed to killing Moore unintentionally while firing at suspected rival gang members.The defense called it a false confession and said Hernandez, who was 17 at the time but charged as an adult, only said he killed Moore because police convinced him it was the only way he would be able to see his family again. Prosecutors countered, saying falsely confessing to a murder made “no sense.”Hernandez remains in custody in Merced County pending sentencing.

122,481229,"Jackson police said a man wanted in connection with a quadruple shooting that killed two people and injured two others has turned himself in.Police said Joshua Hurst, 25, walked into the headquarters with his lawyer Saturday.Police said the shooting happened about 7 p.m. Thursday at a home in the 2900 block of Greenwood Avenue.Jackson Police Department spokeswoman Officer Colendula Green said Hurst was involved in a dice game with several other people inside the home on Greenwood Avenue. Hurst became upset about the game and started shooting, Green said.Police found two of three of the shooting victims at the house, but the fourth victim, who had run from the house, was found about a block away on Maple Ridge Drive, Green said.Ronald J. Williams, 33, who was shot several times, died at the scene, police said. Kendra Hill, 28, died at a local hospital during surgery, police said. She had been shot in the back and leg, Green said.Jason Kimble, 29, and Laquintin Carter, 21, both suffered non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, Green said.Dozens of police officers were called in as emotions boiled over when family and friends rushed to the scene. Some of the officers donned bulletproof vests as they gathered evidence, interviewed witnesses and calmed the crowd.""It's pretty emotional right now, it's also dark,"" Green said Thursday night. ""Some areas are unlit, so our safety is a No. 1 priority, as well as trying to protect any victims or anybody else that's out on the scene.""Police said Hurst is charged with two counts of murder, aggravated assault and being a felon in possession of a firearm.Hurst will appear before court Monday.

The arrest was the second in the case and came as police announced that two additional suspects face the same charges. Police previously had identified only two suspects in the case, but Thursday’s announcement brought to four the total number of people facing charges.One person, identified only as a “male suspect,” is in jail on unrelated charges in another area jurisdiction, police said. They identified the other person as Keith Deangelo Bobb, 21, of Northeast. Police described him as being about 5 feet, 10-inches tall, weighing about 145 pounds, and having a light to medium complexion with hair worn in long dreadlocks.A motive for the shooting remains unclear.<img align=""left"" alt="""" height=""118"" src=""https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2013/05/23/bobb.jpg"" width=""108""/>Surveillance video captured the incident, which occurred around 2:10 a.m. March 11 outside Tyler House, a 284-unit affordable housing complex at the corner of the busy intersection of New York Avenue and North Capitol Street.Two dark-color vehicles were seen driving past the complex. As the first car passed and the shots were fired, a crowd that gathered near the front entrance tried to flee inside the doorway or duck and run.

129,482771,"<a href=""javascript: history.go(-1)"">Back to previous page</a>They tumbled to the sidewalk or ran for cover, scraping and kicking fruitlessly at the locked front door of an apartment building amid a spray of gunfire from two cars speeding down North Capitol Street early Monday.The backdrop was Tyler House, a subsidized-apartment building where violence has visited all too frequently for residents and police. As crime drops across the District and an adjacent neighborhood enjoys a burst of redevelopment, Tyler House remains a stubborn remnant of the area’s history of violence.In the end, 13 people were hit in the drive-by shooting Monday, nearly all of them grazed or struck in their arms or legs. One victim took a bullet to the lower back and was described as being in critical condition.Police said they had few answers to explain the shooting: no motive, no arrests, no information about a gun. Mostly, they and other city officials struggled to assure the public that a quickly gentrifying corner of the city is safe.“I’m saving up my money — because I got a baby on the way — so I can get out of here,” said Tonya Brigdes, 36, one of 284 residents of the eight-story Tyler House. Brigdes, who is nine months pregnant, said she has seen crime ebb and flow over the years. But Monday’s shootings, she said, were a startling reminder of how bad the area can be.Tyler House is surrounded by late-night clubs that police have long blamed for the violence along this stretch of North Capitol Street and New York Avenue. But it is also just blocks from a neighborhood with a new and stylish name — NoMa (for “north of Massachusetts Avenue”) — that city officials and private developers are trying to transform into a thriving center of expensive condominiums, upscale grocers and trendy restaurants.That world seemed far away to the victims and witnesses of Monday’s shooting.“Everybody was screaming,” said Jonique Douglas, 21, who had just come out of a nightclub around the corner and was standing in front of Tyler House when the bullets came. “They shooting like directly at us. Douglas said about a dozen people were standing on the sidewalk about 2:10 a.m., minutes after the club closed. A D.C. police scrambled Monday to piece together what happened and who was involved, although they said no one has been arrested. They did not rule out that someone on North Capitol Street had returned fire; one man said he was struck in the ankle while walking on the other side of the street.The shooting came three years after a similar high-profile shooting in the District; in 2010, Police said they don’t think that Monday’s violence was connected to shootings on the other side of New York Avenue, in front of Big Ben Liquors, that left Instead, police on Monday pointed to a nightclub two blocks away that can hold more than 1,200 people and which D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier has ordered temporarily closed by emergency decree twice since 2011, after a machete attack and a stabbing.The city’s liquor board has investigated 106 complaints at the club since 2004, many involving fights or weapons, and has fined its owners and suspended its license. The holder of the liquor license did not return calls seeking comment.Police said that patrons leaving the Fur Nightclub after its 2 a.m. closing frequently congregate in front of Tyler House, but authorities were unable to say specifically whether a fight or dispute precipitated Monday’s shootings. Authorities said there are many possible motives in a volatile neighborhood, and although residents complained about the clubs, they also noted persistent violence between rival crews.“You won’t get the violence down as much as you’d like until you do something about Tyler House,” D.C. Police Cmdr. Andrew Solberg said in an interview about two weeks ago. He said police have been trying to rehab or close down Tyler House for years.In the early morning, when the clubs in the neighborhood close, “a whole lot of people with cash in their pockets come out onto the street, and the guys from Tyler House are waiting for them,” Solberg said in the earlier interview. “That’s when you get the holdups, and that’s the source of the shootings in the neighborhood.”Like Tyler House, the clubs existed long before the neighborhood attracted developers — when the area consisted mostly of industrial properties and warehouses and was well out of the way of most residential zones. Today, the mix has changed.“The nightclubs are incompatible with the neighborhood,” said D.C. Council member Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), who is chairman of the public safety committee. He noted that the building occupied by the Fur Nightclub has been sold and that its future is in doubt. The shooting occurred just three blocks from the Metro station that serves NoMa — although the locations are separated by a cultural chasm. The walk from the NoMa/Gallaudet Metro stop toward New York Avenue passes through the main development area and along a desolate block past old car repair shops and loading docks. Yellow construction cranes loom overhead, beacons of new development.The NoMa Business Improvement District estimates that the population will grow in the coming years from 2,800 residents to more than 15,000 and that office and retail space will nearly double. Keeping this area and more than a dozen other development zones around the District safe is a On NoMa’s bustling First Street NE, about a block and a half from the shooting, the lunch crowd was not surprised by the morning violence. “The west side of Capitol Street is pretty rough. It’s pretty sketchy,” NoMa resident Eric Fox said as he walked his dog along a street lined with a Harris Teeter supermarket, a Potbelly sandwich shop and luxury apartments.“On this side there are a lot of new apartments,” said Fox, who with his wife regularly sees lights from ambulances and police cars reflecting into their apartment at night. “The west side and the east side are very different.”Monday’s shooting brought into sharp relief the clashing interests of the area. Some long-standing residents welcomed development in NoMa, which, notwithstanding the recent violence, has made the area safer, they said. Others defended lower-income residents who they said are too quickly blamed for the violence. H. Lionel Edmonds, pastor of the Mount Lebanon Baptist Church on New Jersey Avenue, said it’s the new residents “who are incompatible with the neighborhood.”Noting that a nearby boys club is about to shut down, Edmonds said, “There’s a lot of emphasis on buildings and development, but not enough energy going into young black male youth development.”

130,482771,"D.C. police announced on Thursday their first break in Monday’s early morning Late Thursday night, police announced that they had issued an arrest warrant for Craig Wilson for assault with intent to kill in connection with the mass shooting. Wilson has a revolver tattoo on his neck and is described as 6-foot-2 and weighing 140 pounds, authorities said.The statement came hours after police officials identified Wilson and Andrew Davon Allen as people of interest in the case. “We’re trying to locate and interview two people we believe have information on the case,” Cmdr. George Kucik told reporters outside D.C. police headquarters in the afternoon.“We’re looking to see if anyone knows where they might be.”Kucik had a message for the men: “Reach out to us. Come in and talk to us.”Five hours later, police announced the arrest warrant for Wilson but did not release details or why they considered Wilson a suspect. Police also said they had located one of the two vehicles used in the shooting, which occurred about 2:10 a.m. on North Capitol Street, just off New York Avenue in front of an apartment complex called Tyler House.Police haven’t found the other vehicle, Kucik said, described as a dark blue or black 1999 Mercedes-Benz CLK 320 coupe with D.C. license plates EF7810. Police have posted a $10,000 reward for anyone with information leading to an arrest and conviction. Most of the victims suffered minor wounds to their legs and arms, though one was struck in the lower back and critically injured. The number of victims startled a city in which gun violence has been dropping. It occurred at the edge of a neighborhood transitioning into a gentrified district of condos, retail stores and offices. A name given by developers, NoMa, short for north of Massachusetts Avenue, has stuck.But Monday’s violence and the fact that several victims, Police have not described a motive, and they said little about the case Thursday. Authorities have indicated that they are looking into whether a dispute at the club precipitated the violence, or whether the incident is tied to long-standing beefs between neighborhood crews from Tyler House and those on the other side of New York Avenue in Truxton Circle.“There’s a lot to do in this case,” Kucik said. “We’re getting there.”"

Instead of darkness hanging over the park, there is hope.“We’re the peacekeepers here – we really are,” Garcia said. “We can strive for more.”Garcia was shot six times that fateful night – twice in the head. He said the shooting not only changed his life, but his community.Now a student at Mira Costa College, Garcia said the shooting made him realize that making his community a safer and better place is possible.Project REACH helped him and now, in turn, he helps mentor youth through the program.Jimmy Figueroa with Project REACH said the program and events like Friday’s celebration are living proof of the change that has transpired in the community.“You live in this community where, yes, tragedy has happened, but you’re saying, ‘That might have been the past but it’s not going to be my reality. It’s not my expectations that I have for my community and myself,’” he explained.Over the past couple of years, Figueroa said he’s seen local youth go from being sad and frustrated to channeling their emotions into creating positive change through the common goal of inspiring and influencing younger generations.Now, Libby Lake Park is packed with kids and teens playing instead of living in fear.“It’s their park now, and they’re enjoying it,” said Figueroa.Many teens like Garcia have rallied together through the Project REACH after-school program. They've done Public Service Announcements aimed at keeping teens away from drugs and violence.Oceanside Police Department Lt. Leonard Cosby said the youth should be extremely proud of the work they’re doing and the difference they are making in the area.“Our crime rate this year is down over 9 percent and our gang-related crime rate is down over 30 percent,” said Lt. Cosby. “For the community, it’s a great thing.”So, on a day that could’ve been full of grief, the community and Garcia chose to focus on just how far they've come and what lies ahead in the future – a future Garcia is so grateful to have.“I want for my future to be successful.  Every day that you live you have to do something new, otherwise you’re not living,” he said.Eventually, Garcia plans to transfer from Mira Costa College to UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley or Pepperdine University.

136,482801,"The District Attorney’s Office has announced that it will not seek the death penalty against a group of men charged in the fatal shootings of two teens last year at Libby Lake Park in Oceanside.Martin Melendrez, 23; Santo Diaz, 20, and Michael Zurita, 21; and Kevin Brizuela, 19, each face two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder in connection with the shootings on March 13, 2013.The men also face special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders, which gave prosecutors the option of seeking the executions of three defendants who were adults at the time of the shootings. They now face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.Because Brizuela was 17 when the killings occurred, he is not eligible for the death penalty. However, he could be sent to prison for life if he is found guilty.Deputy District Attorney Christine Bannon made the announcement Tuesday in front of Vista Superior Court Judge Carlos Armour. She did not give any specific reasons as to why prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty, but she explained that District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis had met with the defense lawyers in the case, as well as other high-level prosecutors in her office and consulted with the victims' family members.The defendants are accused of ambushing and killing Melanie Virgen, 13, and Edgar Sanchez, 15, on a hilltop at the Oceanside park. The pair was seated on a couch near a makeshift memorial for two other teens gunned down at the same spot in 2011. Police and prosecutors have said the 2013 attack was motivated by a gang rivalry, but the victims, including two older teen boys who were wounded but survived, did not have gang ties."

Police say three men pulled out guns and began shooting. Seven  people were hit, six  men and one 19-year-old woman.Police say they found bullets inside and even outside the club. The  teenage woman is in serious but stable condition. The six men shot are all in stable condition. A promotional poster indicated rap artists Nino, King Samson and Lil Mouse, who was releasing the CD, performed at the event.Mr. G's owner Gene Linton said he was there, and the trouble started outside his business.  ""As I was   locking the door, a guy said on the outside that, 'They're shooting   outside. They're shooting outside.' I allowed him to get in. When I got the key to lock the door  I heard some shots and everyone went out,"" he said.   Linton confirms he heard gang lingo being yelled outside.  Mr. G's has been there since 1990, hosts showers and family gatherings and has a solid reputation, Linton said, adding it was the first time in a long time he's opened his doors to a rap music group.   ""I've been there going on 23 years; I've never had a situation that happened like this before. At every event at Mr. G's, there is someone at my door with security to see your ID and what's in your purse, and we pat them down,"" Linton said.   Sherese Reed, who lives across the street, said she attended an adult entertainment party at Mr. G's in December and confirmed security has always been present. She is thinking about going back and says crime is happening all over.  ""i can't live in fear and say, 'i can't go here,' and 'i can't go there,'"" she said.

155,483737,"2 Min ReadCHICAGO (Reuters) - Seven people were shot and wounded early Thursday morning at a party at a Chicago nightclub in an incident that police said may have been gang related. All seven were in stable condition after being treated at local hospitals after being shot during what appeared to be a dispute between two rival gangs at Mr. G’s Supper Club and Entertainment Center on the city’s south side, said Chicago police spokesman John Mirabelli. The wounded included a 19-year-old woman and six men aged 21 to 36. Promotional posters indicate local rap artists ‘Lil Mouse, King Samson and Nino performed at the event, according to news reports. One man who has at the party said Samson was not involved in the shooting. “We didn’t have anything to do with what’s going on,” said Justin Lewis, who identified himself as Samson’s manager. “We were toward the back when everything was happening. I guess it happened toward the front.” Representatives of ‘Lil Mouse and Nino could not be reached for immediate comment. ‘Lil Mouse recently faced criticism for a music video he produced last year when he was 13 years old that featured strong language and showed people waving guns in the camera. Fighting among gangs has claimed a mounting toll of lives in some predominantly African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods of Chicago over the last year. Chicago surpassed 500 homicides last year for the first time since 2008. A high school girl who performed at President Barack Obama’s inauguration, Hadiya Pendleton, was gunned down earlier this year at a park about a mile away from the Obama’s Chicago home. Her death focused national attention on Chicago’s murder rate, and First Lady Michelle Obama attended her funeral.

A promotional poster indicated rap artists Nino, King Samson and Lil Mouse performed at the event.A YouTube video for the Lil Mouse song “Im 4real” shows the rapper and his crew wearing apparel emblazoned with the phrase “no talking” — an apparent reference to the no-snitch code that governs much of the city’s gang violence. The song lyrics feature gratuitous allusions to gun violence.Three people — a 19-year-old woman, 21-year-old man and 23-year-old man — were driven to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn with gunshot wounds, Alfaro said.

Never has any incident of this magnitude occurred at the establishment.”Linton’s statement said the “senseless” incident “initiated on the exterior of our building after hours” and he is conducting a review of all security measures at the nightclub in conjunction with the police investigation.Additionally, Linton said, “We ask that the general public join us in praying for the victims of this cowardly act.

""I'm just glad to be out of there. It's been a stressful week for me.""Brown has been arrested two other times — and both of those were bogus arrests, his relatives and court papers say.The first time the Coney Island native was arrested was back on May 9, 2007, when he was walking home after a day of work at his neighborhood Pathmark.Brown was stopped by officers and arrested on drug possession charges. The charges were later dropped, and Brown sued for false arrest. The city settled his claim for $30,000.He was arrested again this past Nov. 1, when police identified him as one of the 16 looters who ripped off a Neptune Ave. Key Food after Hurricane Sandy.Brown was spotted walking out of the Key Food ""carrying property"" about midnight on Halloween, the criminal complaint says. He was charged with felony burglary, misdemeanor criminal trespass and petty larceny.The burglary charge was later dismissed, and Brown's cousin Donald Franks predicted the other charges would be dropped as well.""He was just out there looking for his nephew,"" Franks said.Brown said he doesn't understand why the cops keep arresting him. ""I did feel targeted, and I didn't understand why this was being done to me. I just couldn't understand it. But I'm home now, and that's all that matters,"" he said Friday. ""My family's still behind me, from day one, and if it wasn't for them, I'd probably still be sitting inside there now.""Relatives predicted that Brown would be filing suit — but now he has far more serious charges hanging over his head.Brown said he was playing Call of Duty: Black Ops at a friend's home on March 22 when he heard there had been a shooting at the home of a longtime family friend, Eva Natal. The gunman and a female accomplice had shot Natal, two of her sons and another man, Angel Rivera, before fleeing the Gravesend Houses apartment. Rivera was killed in the bloody attack.Brown's family and friends said he soon received more shocking news — police had identified him as the gunman.""He was with us the whole time,"" said his friend Shawna Brown, who's no relation. Friends and family were in disbelief when they saw Brown's face pop up on the news. ""He was watching things unfold as we were,"" Shawna Brown said.With the help of his brother and father, Joseph Brown surrendered to the police.Brown and several other witnesses spoke to investigators, and told them that he was with them at the time of the 3:30 p.m. shooting.Brown was slapped with murder and other charges, and locked up for a week before prosecutors consented to his release on Friday. They said they were ""still investigating to make sure we have the correct individual in custody.""He's due back in court on May 29.Brown's family said that one of the victims of the shooting is legally blind, and might have thought Brown was the shooter because the suspect had braids like Brown used to have.""Everybody's always slandering this kid,"" Shawna Brown said.

Three people are dead following a gang shooting Saturday night in the 9200 block of Westside Boulevard in the Atwater area, the Merced County Sheriff's Department reported.The victims are described as two males, 18 and 19 years old, and a female in her mid-teens, according to Sheriff Mark Pazin.The female victim died on Sunday after being taken to a Modesto hospital for surgery.Two other males were wounded during the incident, a 16 and 21-year-old, and were transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.The shooting happened around 11 p.m. Saturday, after a group of people approached a rival gang at a party near the residence. Pazin said the group was having some sort of Easter gathering, and the rivals were able to sneak up on them. Multiple shots rang out after the confrontation, he said, followed by a series of 911 calls.Merced and Atwater police arrived on the scene, as well are the fire department. Pazin said many of those injured had already been transported to hospitals when Sheriff's deputies arrived.Authorities said the motive behind Saturday’s shooting was gang-related.""Was it gangs involved? Yes, it was,"" Pazin said during a news conference Sunday. ""We're not going to sugar coat it. The absolute immaturity and insensitivity over a couple of gang colors is just breathtaking.""Pazin said the Sheriff's Department won’t release the victims' names out of respect for the families on Easter Sunday, however, they have been notified.""We want to give them some time to catch up and grope for answers in this nonsensical system that we call gang violence,"" he said.Many of the witnesses have been uncooperative, but the major crime unit is working on piecing together what happened during the incident. There are no suspects in custody at this time, Pazin said.The three deaths mark the 8th homicide for Merced County this year.

Two suspected gang members on Thursday were ordered to stand trial for killing two teenagers at a large house party outside Atwater.Jose L. Botello, 19, and Jose M. Carballido, 20, have pleaded not guilty to murder in connection with the deaths of Samantha Parreira, 16, and Matthew Fisher, 19.Both victims were shot to death March 30, 2013, in the backyard of a party in the 9200 block of Westside Boulevard, outside Atwater.Judge Ronald W. Hansen on Thursday held both Botello and Carballido to answer for homicides following a preliminary hearing in Merced Superior Court.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Parreira’s mother, Desiree, said she was pleased with the judge’s ruling to keep both men in custody.“I think all the information brought out this afternoon will help put these guys away and will help find peace of both Matthew’s family and for my Sami,” Desiree Parreira said.Diane Reis, Fisher’s mother, echoed Parreira’s statements.“I’m glad they’re being held responsible for taking my son’s young life,” Reis said outside the courtroom. “Maybe we finally see some kind of closure.”Investigators from the Merced County Sheriff’s Department testified during Thursday’s preliminary hearing, along with witnesses with information regarding the case.Deputies testified that Botello and Carballido were both members of an Atwater street gang. Investigators said both men attended the party and said multiple people from other rival gangs were also at the party. Deputies believe Botello rushed toward Fisher in the backyard and opened fire, striking Fisher and Parreira, who was seated close to Fisher at the time of the shooting.Deputies testified that Carballido was next to Botello during the shooting. They described Carballido as possibly serving as a lookout for Botello during the violence.Robert Wynne, Carballido’s attorney, said his client did not know Botello was armed and was not aware of any plans to confront gang members at the party.“My client was just standing there,” Wynne said.Botello’s attorney, Ty Kharazi, said Botello’s arrest remains a case of mistaken identity.“There are two witnesses who are in Southern California that say our clients didn’t do it,” Kharazi said. “We’re conducting further investigation, but they didn’t do the shooting.”One other man was killed during the same party, but deputies have said his death was unrelated to the slayings of Fisher and Parreira.Bernabed Hernandez-Canela, 18, was shot and killed in front of the house, apparently while multiple guns were being fired and dozens of people were fleeing the scene, authorities have said.Hernandez-Canela’s death received additional scrutiny last year when Ethan B. Morse, son of Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse II, was charged with murder in connection with the homicide. Morse was accused of driving a getaway vehicle while his co-defendant, Jacob Tellez, was charged with shooting Hernandez-Canela.Morse and Tellez, however, were found innocent in November after a preliminary hearing before Hansen, the same judge who handed down Thursday’s ruling.Botello and Carballido remain in custody at the Merced County jail without bail. They are scheduled to return to court June 19.Rob Parsons:

Three Merced County youths have been arrested in connection with a suspected gang-related shooting last year at a house party near Atwater that left three teenagers dead, the Merced County Sheriff’s Department confirmed.Gunfire erupted March 30, 2013, during an Easter holiday party in the area of the 9200 block of Westside Boulevard. Three people – Samantha Parreira, 16; Bernabed Hernandez-Canela, 18; and Matthew Fisher, 19 – were fatally shot and two other young people were injured. “Three young people were killed that night, and hopefully this will bring a little bit of closure, but we will never forget, ever forget,” said Desiree Parreira, Samantha’s mother.Families of the other victims could not be reached Thursday for comment.Jose L. Botello and Jose M. Carballido, both 19-year-old Atwater residents, and Jacob Tellez, 18, of Merced, were arrested by detectives with the sheriff’s Major Crimes Unit this week on suspicion of murder and gang participation, Detective-Sgt. Chuck Hale said at a Thursday news conference.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.All three suspects remained behind bars Thursday without bail.Tellez was arrested early Thursday in San Jose. He was still going through the booking process Thursday afternoon and a mugshot was not immediately available. Botello and Carballido were arrested late Wednesday in Atwater. Both Atwater residents belong to the same criminal street gang, and Tellez is a member of another gang, Hale said.Detectives have not ruled out the possibility of making additional arrests. Deputies said the party started as a holiday gathering for high school students that escalated when word of the gathering spread through social media and text messages, attracting more than 100 people, including members of several Merced County street gangs.Hale declined to comment on the specific incidents at the party that sparked the gun violence, saying releasing certain details, including the number of shooters or whether any murder weapons have been recovered, could harm the investigation. Cooperation from the public and witnesses was a critical factor in making the arrests, Hale said, although he stressed the need for additional help. “There are other people out there that have more information about this party and we invite them to come forward,” Hale said.Desiree Parreira pleaded for anyone with knowledge of the incident to reach out to sheriff’s investigators. “Don’t be scared,” she said Thursday. “If we keep running around being scared, these gangs are just going to take over and they’re going to take everybody away from us.”She described her daughter as a “charismatic, go-getting” young lady who was close to her siblings. The family on Monday celebrated what would have been Samantha’s 18th birthday. She would have graduated from high school earlier this year. “We don’t get to share those things with her anymore. I don’t get to have that anymore and it’s not fair,” she said.“When she was taken from me, it just hardened my heart to know there’s people out there who’d take her away from us.”Parreira’s aunt, Charlotte Alves, said she was “overjoyed” with news of the arrests. “My Sammie was such a good girl. Her smile could light up any room,” Alves said. “She had so much life, so many dreams that will never be accomplished now. This means so much.”Sheriff Tom Cavallero praised the work of the detectives and deputies “who collaborated so well in this effort and were absolutely driven to bring about a resolution.”Desiree Parreira said the arrests sparked a range of emotions and hadn’t really “sunk in” yet. She said all the families want justice for their loved ones. “My daughter was 16 years old, and I’m never going to see her again because of these people,” she said. “I’ve learned to forgive, but I’ll never forget.”

My family members are police officers in other states and they do a better job than I saw this morning. But I must say that if alcohol wasn't involved this horrible lose of life would never have happened. Very sad. What was so darn important that it's worth killing three people? Americans killing Americans for what? Correction – blacks killing blacks  Nick, one of the victims, is white. Don't be an ignorant clown How do you know that all the men that were killed were Black?? some people are just ignorant! Sorry that was meant for happy_pessimist that place needs to be shut down for real its hecka bad there now they allow to much stuff inside that place     SHUT IT DOWN !!!!!!!!!!  You'll never get anywhere as a stupid thug. Jail time, prison and death aren't good goals in life.  Some media are reporting, this brawl started over some dumb jealous rivalry between two thug women. Unbelievable! It's hard to believe this is 2013 and we have such stupid people in our community. You talking about Antuan? Shame on you Lewy.  It ain't nice making fun of dead bros. Who wants to bet that these thug women are fat, stupid, and uuuuugly!!!  Take bullets for that POS'???  These nigs ain't  too bright and deserved it. It is so easy to blame the establishment where the senseless tragedy happened. It is not the tavern’s fault. This was the fault of the people who thought that killing three men was the only way to prove their point in an argument. There was no honor or integrity shown in ending the lives of those three men. Only cowardice and idiocy.This sounds like a bona-fide modern day L'trag edy what do you call it when white people kill? the snake's being evil again?  donkey`'s bee effing each other is what white crime would be considered. it sure dont take a particular race to act ignorant because i have seen every race act like an idiot…so whitesliver can hide at his desk and make ignorant comments and feel good bout himself but reality is your time will come and i do hope when it does you are alone and scared and suffer terribly. thanx and have a nice day. :) Auburn, Washington is the arm pit of south king county,  and it get's worse every year. I live and work in auburn (THE ARM PIT) so sad os gun control i wonder how many of the guns were registered to legal gun owners, but control the guns that honest people have to protect themselves. I sorry there family’s that are mourning the death of family a member it’s a hard thing to do. No matter the race of shooters death like this is wrong. Until our country as whole renounce violence we will just keep on killing any body we want just like our wonderful wonderful government dose. Look out Korea. Prayers go out to the families that lost there loved ones. And for the ones that witnessed this horrible tragedy. My love goes out to all that were affected by this. RIP to the angels that grew there wings so early. And for the ones that cant say anything nice about what happened I pray for you too!!!!! I hope that the suspects are found soon and JUSTICE be served!!! Leighanne;  I was wandering thru the news items and low and behold, there’s leighanne. Hope that your family is fine. Tell Manual and the children Hi! Any way, good luck and come back to see us.You Americans will just keep shooting each other as a solution to everything AND the NRA is laughing at you!!!  your a dumb ass Cowards The likelihood that these were LEGAL and REGISTERED guns and owners is highly unlikely to answer one commentors question here. As a former Auburn resident, I know first hand what has happened to Auburn. When I first moved there it was a quiet and lovely small town. Soon after the open border policy I saw it all fall apart to the point that I simply moved out. But everywhere I moved to, the problems continued. People do not realize the serious extent of violent crime that has come to WA state, and indeed our country in general,  along with our open borders here in the southwest. The Black and Mexican gangs now vying with each other over 'territory' which is more often then not, dealing with drug trafficking and other illegal crime, is tearing our communities and children apart. It is time to demand serious answers from this government. Taking away everyone else's right to defend themselves against these criminals is not the answer nor will it change reality. Criminals will simply smuggle guns, oh so easily, over the Mexican border as they do every single day, and continue to kill innocent citizens whose guns our government, and the uninformed public, have decided we don't need to protect ourselves. Our police cars USED to say, 'To protect and Serve.' Today, they only serve….the law. They do not, nor can they protect us. A criminal will kill you in 1 second. A 911 call takes an average of 9-15 mins to see a response. Those odds simply aren't good enough for me…or those that I love. I moved to south Texas to get AWAY from the increasing violence as well as the progressive ideals that the state of  Washington now embraces on an ever escalating scale, to the detriment of it's law abiding citizens. Now, sadly, I watch as hundreds of illegals, and many of them terrorists, cross these same borders into our country daily. Our government does nothing to stop this nor do they want to apparently. They have had 60 years to contain our borders and have done absolutely nothing but waste billions of dollars APPEARING to do something while doing absolutely nothing. They even hinder our actual Border Patrol agents from doing their jobs to secure our borders. This is not news to Texans, Californian's and others who border Mexico. What is most alarming however is the cartels, Terrorists and gangs allowed to flow freely into this country while those in Washington and the News Media whom they control, continue to lie to us and use minor issues to continue to divide us and keep of ignorant of what the real issues of today truly are. God bless you Washingtonians that are stuck there and the families and others who are subject daily to the criminal component of society that our politicians are encouraging and breeding. I think I will stay in Texas where the law is still the law and the right to defend oneself is still available and legal to the detriment of the criminals who walk among us. I devised a method of losing weight that focuses solely on turning off the fat switch. And that's how I lost my weight and that's how everyone else who is following The Gabriel Method is losing weight too. The Gabriel Method shows you how to lose weight easily and naturally, WITHOUT DIETING, by working with your body's natural genetic programming, rather than against it. You all sound so ridiculously stupid talking about race. Who cares the color no one deserves to get shot. Only one man that got shot was black.

176,483817,"The three men who died in an eruption of gunfire outside a popular Auburn sports bar early Easter morning were friends who frequently hung out together, according to mourners gathered outside the crime-scene tape Sunday.The men were killed, and a fourth man critically injured, when several people pulled handguns and began firing after an argument in the parking lot as the Sports Page tavern was closing around 1:30 a.m., said Auburn police Cmdr. Mike Hirman.Another man was detained and questioned about his involvement, Hirman said. Later in the day, he was arrested on suspicion of an unrelated weapons violation but remained a person of interest in the shooting incident as investigators sorted through a large amount of information, Hirman said.The police commander said as many as 50 people were milling around when an argument between several men, mostly in their 20s, escalated into a gunfight. By midmorning Sunday, several grieving family members and friends had gathered near the parking lot of the strip mall where the tavern is located on Auburn Way North. The sheet-draped bodies were visible between the police cars as detectives moved through the crime scene.Accounts from those on the scene about what led to the shooting differ, although most seem to agree that it began when someone fired a shot into the air and several other people began shooting.“Some sort of dispute erupted — you know, over a girl or words or something, and somebody started shooting and then somebody else started shooting,” Hirman said. “Young men, alcohol and guns is a bad combination.” That dispute started inside the bar when a woman became angry that another woman was dancing with her boyfriend, Hirman said. It then moved outside and escalated, he said.Hirman said two groups were involved in the incident — one that went to the bar to celebrate a birthday and another that arrived together. But some people from both groups knew one another, he said.Detectives recovered several handguns from the crime scene, though there might have been additional weapons, Hirman said, adding that as many as a dozen people may have been involved in the fight.Hirman said police talked to a number of eyewitnesses and were still trying to sort out what happened. “There were so many people there and so many involved,” Hirman said. “There were probably 50 people there, and everyone saw something different. One thing we know we have is guns and drinking.” Bernice Buchanan, of Des Moines, said her son Lorenzo Duncan, 23, was one of the three who died. The distraught woman said her son was a “loving, caring, loving Christian guy.” Duncan was the peace maker when his friends started arguments, according to Buchanan and Larry Duncan, the victim’s father. “When I say he was respectful, that’s without question because that’s the way I raised him,” Buchanan said. “And for me to know that I’ll never hear his voice again” breaks her heart, she said. His father said, “It’s hard to express how much we’ll miss him. This seems like a nightmare.”Police had not identified any of the victims officially, pending reports from the King County Medical Examiner. The Seattle Times was withholding the identities of the other victims pending official word or confirmation by their families.One man using the street name “Fast,” who otherwise wouldn’t identify himself, said he and Lorenzo Duncan patronized the Sports Page every weekend.His wife said they had left the bar before the shooting began and from their home nearby heard the police sirens.She said there have been fights at the bar in the past. “If someone had a beef with someone else, they know they’ll see them at the bar the next week,” she said.The youngest of the three men who died had just turned 21 and was able to legally go to the tavern, his friends said. Laneisha Robinson, 20, who went to school with him, said through tears, “I couldn’t even stay in church this morning. It was hard to see everyone happy when I’m not.”Lorenzo Duncan, she said, had a way of making people laugh.  Robinson said the third victim was a personal-fitness trainer with two children. “I never would have seen this coming,” Robinson said.“My generation, everybody wants to just shoot rather than just work things out,” she said. “Now three men are dead.”Hirman said the parking lot was mayhem when the shooting stopped. The fourth shooting victim, who is in his late 30s, was thrown into the back of a car and rushed by friends to Auburn Regional Medical Center. He was later transferred to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he remained in “very serious” but stable condition with multiple gunshot wounds, Hirman said late Sunday.Hirman said one bullet-riddled car was found in Kent and another in Federal Way. Those vehicles were impounded. Several other cars connected to the incident also were impounded at the scene.By late Sunday, no formal charges had been filed against anyone. “We’ve been in touch with the prosecutor and trying to make the right decision when it comes to charges, Hirman said. “We need to ask a lot more questions first.”<em>Seattle Times staff reporter Steve Miletich contributed to this story.</em><em>Lornet Turnbull: lturnbull@seattletimes.com or 206-464-2420.</em>

178,483817,"By CaptionCloseTwo years after a three people were shot dead in a gunfight outside an Auburn sports bar, a Kent man has been charged in two of the killings.King County prosecutors claim Cleanthony Baby Ray Jimerson killed Nicholas John Lindsay and Lorenzo Deshawn Duncan during a March 31, 2013 shootout. Jimerson, 29, was also shot during the early morning gunfight outside the Sports Page Tavern.Now charged with two counts of second-degree murder and related crimes, Jimerson was arrested Friday outside Austin, Texas. Prosecutors in Seattle are preparing to extradite him.Prosecutors claim Jimerson, a convicted felon, grabbed a gun from his car after a fistfight broke out in the bar parking lot. He is alleged to have fatally shot Lindsay and Duncan at close range.“He shot and killed both Nicholas Lindsay and Lorenzo Duncan while they were on the ground, defenseless,” Senior Deputy Prosecutor Charles Sergis told the court. “Several witnesses describe the killing as execution-style.”Charging papers describe a chaotic clash between two groups of people shortly before 2 a.m. in the parking lot of the Sports Page, located at 2802 Auburn Way North.Police arrived to find Lindsay, 26, and Duncan, 23, dead alongside a third shooting victim, 21-year-old Antuan Greer. Officers recovered spent casing and live rounds in five calibers, indicating several shooters were involved in the gunfight.Jimerson arrived at an Auburn hospital minutes later. He’d been shot several times, and driven there by his brother. Shot three times, Jimerson was rushed to Harborview Medical Center.Investigators claim Jimerson and several members of his family were at the bar as part of a “going away party” for his brother, who was headed to prison for gun crimes. Lindsay, Duncan and Greer were attending a birthday party that night.An argument on the dance floor spilled out into the parking lot, where a fist fight ensued, an Auburn detective said in charging papers.Recounting video of the fight, the detective said Lindsay was knocked to the ground by a “sucker punch.” Greer was trying to pull people away from Lindsay, when the shooting started.While witness accounts varied, investigators claim several described seeing Jimerson stand over Lindsay and shoot him twice. According to charging papers, Jimerson shot Duncan as he attempted to run from the fight, and then shot him again after he hit the ground.Jimerson was shot moments later, according to charging papers. He is alleged to have crawled into a car still holding his pistol, and then waited for his relatives to take him to a hospital.The person who claimed to have shot Jimerson told police he did so because he wanted to stop him from killing, the detective said. Another witness told police the shooting “was not a ‘gangster hit’ like it has been rumored but ‘an act of cowardice.’”Autopsies of the slain men would show that Lindsay was shot in the upper chest with a bullet that struck his heart. Duncan was shot in the back and in the face, wounds that appear to support witness accounts that he was first show while running away and then executed.According to charging papers, Jimerson denied shooting anyone and claimed to have been shot while attempting to leave the bar.Investigators claim at least five people were shooting during the gunfight. It is not clear from charging papers whether any suspects have been identified in Greer’s killing, or if he was caught in the cross fire.Jimerson is subject to a $5 million warrant. He has been charged with unlawful gun possession as well as two counts of second-degree murder.<strong>Seattlepi.com reporter Levi Pulkkinen can be reached at 206-448-8348 or </strong>"

180,483861,"David Stumbo, 8th Circuit Solicitor, said his office dropped the murder charge against a man in a 2013 homicide case. Greenwood Police say 15-year-old Malik Padgett, of Columbia, was shot and killed while visiting family in Greenwood during Spring Break in April 2013. Five other men were also shot but survived the shooting. The shooting happened during a birthday party along Tabor Street. Malik Padgett's mother said her son was about to come home from his cousin's home where he had just gotten a haircut, and was caught in the line of fire.  Days after the shooting Greenwood Police arrested 17-year-old Dayterrious White and charged him with murder. Then in June of last year, 26-year-old Jason Aiken was arrested and charged with murder and five founts of attempted murder. However, more than a year later, 8FOX Carolina On Friday afternoon Stumbo released the following statement:  ""Upon further investigation by law enforcement, and consideration of the evidence as it currently exists, the decision has been made to dismiss the indictments against defendant Jason Aiken with leave for the State to re-indict should new evidence come to light. It would be improper and unethical for my office to continue to pursue charges that, at this time, cannot be supported with credible evidence. We will continue to work alongside the Greenwood Violent Crimes Task Force investigators as they pursue further leads on this case. Our continued sympathy and prayers are with the family of Malik Padgett as they mourn their loss, and we will never give up hope that the perpetrators of this tragedy will soon be brought to justice.""In regards to Dayterrious White's charges in the case, Stumbo said, ""At this time, the charges against Dayterrious White are still pending. The investigation on this case is ongoing.""""I want my son's killer found,"" said Latarsha Padgett, ""But I don't want the wrong person charged.""Anyone with information on this shooting is asked to call Greenwood Police at 864-942-8632. <em>Copyright 2014 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation) All rights reserved. </em>"

193,484268,"<em>This post has been updated.</em>A woman was killed and three men were wounded when gunfire erupted on a crowded Kensington block early Tuesday evening, police said.Officers were called to Somerset Street near Lee shortly before 6 p.m. for the report of several people shot outside on the street, Chief Inspector Scott Small said at the scene.A 21-year-old woman who was shot twice in the torso was rushed to Episcopal Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m., Small said. Three other victims, men ages 18, 21 and 35, were taken to Temple University Hospital, each suffering multiple gunshot wounds to their legs and abdomen. All three were listed in stable condition around 7:30 p.m., Small said.Police said witnesses told them the block had been crowded with people all day, and that several fights -- possibly over drugs -- broke out earlier. Investigators were looking into the possibility that the shooting is related to those fights.Emmanuel Negron, 23, was coming out of a corner store across the street from the shooting when he heard the shots.""The lady was over there laying down. They picked her up and put her in a car,"" Negron said. ""It was so much commotion right here. So many people were trying to get her out.""Nancy Agosto, 36, another neighborhood resident, was also near the block when the shooting broke out. Agosto, who grew up in the neighborhood, shook her head as she surveyed the broad-daylight shooting scene.""It's crazy. Innocent people,"" Agosto said. ""I've got a daughter myself. She's five. It's scary.""Police described the shooter as a man with a light complexion, 5 feet 3 to 5 feet 5, who wore a dark T-shirt and jeans. He was last seen running west on Somerset Street.Police are unsure which, if any, of the victims was the intended target, and were still sorting out the circumstances surrounding the shooting around 7:30 p.m.Residents who stood at the end of the trash-strewn block watching police investigate said they've had enough of the shootings in their neighborhood -- which become commonplace, especially once the weather gets warm.""It's crazy, man. I have a son, I've been trying to get out of this area. I can't do this,"" Negron said. ""The weather gets warm and people start acting like animals out here.""Negron, the father of a 1-year-old boy, said he felt for the woman who was shot as he watched her lie on the ground, bleeding.""I can't imagine how she was feeling. With a crowd of people outside, they [the shooter] didn't care,"" he said. ""I don't want my son around this s---.""<em>Anyone with information about this shooting or any other crime should contact police at 215-686-TIPS (8477), or text a tip to PPD TIP (773847). Tipsters may remain anonymous. </em>

198,484279,"Shooting in Vallejo  The shootings happened at about 10 p.m. in North Vallejo on Mini Drive. Police said the gunman was in one car and was pursuing the victims in another car. At least 30 rounds were fired. No residents in their homes were hurt. The victims' car crashed when the driver was shot. The shooter's car fled the scene.  ""When (police) arrived on scene, there was a male and female inside the vehicle that we contacted and two other individuals fled from the scene. A local resident called because (the shooting victims) had been banging on their door, so we were able to pick (the shooting victims) up as well,"" said Vallejo Police Sgt. Brett Clark.  All four victims are expected to survive.   Police said they don't know the motive behind the attack and the victims are not cooperating. All police have been told is that the shooter was in a white small car and they do not have suspect description. Police said the casings from the shootings came from a handgun and rifles - so there may have been more than one shooter.           "
199,484279,"VALLEJO (CBS SF) – Police in Vallejo are investigating a shooting that left four people hospitalized on Wednesday night, a police lieutenant said.Officers responded to reports of shots fired in the 1800 block of Mini Drive at about 10 p.m., Lt. Lee Horton said.Moments later, residents of nearby Betty Court called 911 after victims of the shooting knocked on their doors seeking help, Horton said.When officers arrived, they determined that four people — three men and one woman — had been injured by the gunfire, the lieutenant said.Three of the victims were transported to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek and another to NorthBay Medical Center in Fairfield to be treated for injuries, Horton said.All four victims were expected to survive, he said.Police found between 20 and 30 shell casings of multiple calibers on the street, and there was bullet damage to nearby cars and homes, Horton said.The victims, who were all inside a white car at the time of the shooting, told investigators the shots were fired from inside a dark-colored car, according to Horton. After the shooting, the victims’ car crashed into a parked car, he said.Horton said it is unknown exactly how the incident happened, but said the victims were the targets of the attack.Police were looking into whether the shots came from anywhere other than the dark-colored car, and whether the shooting was gang-related, Horton said.The suspects fled the area in the car and remain at large, he said. Suspect descriptions were not immediately available.The investigation into the shooting was ongoing.Anyone with information was asked to call Vallejo police at (800) 488-9383 or anonymously at (707) 644-7867. (Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

Police released a photo Monday of a man whom detectives want to talk to about a shooting that left one dead and four injured just before midnight Sunday at Lexington's Eastland Bowling Lanes.The man's image was captured on surveillance cameras in the bowling alley.Lexington Police Sgt. Pete Ford said during a news conference Monday that detectives do not know who the man is. Ford said the man was not considered a suspect or person of interest in the shooting death of Steven Reynolds.The man could ""have information that is crucial to this investigation,"" Ford said. ""This is just somebody we'd like to talk to.""No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Lexington police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts said police were ""working on identifying suspects at this point."" Police did not release many details about the shooting, the scene of which was described as pandemonium.The coroner identified Reynolds, 22, of Lexington early Monday. Authorities did not release the names of the injured.Reynolds was pronounced dead at 12:26 a.m. Monday at University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center, according to the Fayette County coroner's office. He died of a gunshot wound, a news release said.Roberts said the most seriously wounded person was taken to UK Hospital and underwent surgery.The bowling alley apparently was hosting an event for college-age people, Roberts said.Danny Collins, president of Collins Bowling Centers, which owns Eastland, said the event was called Soul Bowl and featured a disc jockey. There were about 160 people at the party, which began at 9 p.m. Sunday and was scheduled to end at midnight, Collins said.A group of people confronted others who were bowling, and alley officials decided to end the event after the confrontation got physical, Collins said. The shooting started as they were getting everybody out of the building, he said. No bowling alley employees were injured, he said.Ford said initial calls to police described the situation as ""a riot.""""Once the gunfire rang out, you can expect some pandemonium to occur,"" Ford said. That environment made it difficult for officers to locate witnesses and preserve evidence, he added.""It's a difficult situation because you don't know who's involved and who's not involved, and it's just a chaotic scene, so we are trying to piece together everything,"" he said. ""Right now this is like having a thousand-piece puzzle, and we're just trying to put everything back together.""Ford confirmed accounts of minor altercations in  the bowling alley before the shooting. Ford said he did not know how many people fired shots. He would not say whether police had recovered a weapon.He also said he did not know how many victims remained hospitalized late Monday afternoon. The bowling alley was closed Monday, and Collins said he expected to reopen Tuesday afternoon.""We're a family-oriented business,"" he said. The event targeted people who liked to bowl later at night, but it ""was a nice environment"" and ""a clean-run"" event, Collins said.""We've been in business for 50 years, and nothing like this has ever happened.""Collins said he no longer would hold the Soul Bowl. Ford said police didn't want the incident to reflect badly on the bowling alley.""I do believe this is an isolated event,"" he said. ""We would encourage everyone to go back and visit with this facility in the future. They will continue to do what they can do to make it a safe and pleasant environment for everyone involved.""Reynolds' uncle James Reynolds said during a telephone interview that his nephew ""was a good young kid"" and the father of a young son.""This violence needs to stop,"" Reynolds said.Several people posted condolences for Steven Reynolds on the social network website Twitter. One of them was Winston Guy Jr., a former safety on the UK football team who now plays for the Seattle Seahawks. He said the news made him cry.During a telephone interview, Guy was in tears as he talked of growing up with Reynolds in Lexington's Winburn neighborhood. Guy said he had not seen Reynolds in a few years, but ""I'm hurt because in my eyes he was like a brother.""""He was somebody's son, he was somebody's cousin, he had a sister. Life is too precious, too short,"" Guy said.

One of the five men shot at Eastland Bowling Lanes Sunday night described the scene as a ""war zone"" and ""battlefield,"" with more than one person shooting.Malcolm Williams told the Herald-Leader Tuesday that he doesn't think he and his friends were the intended targets. Williams, 22, said he was ""good friends"" with Steven Reynolds, also 22, who died from a gunshot wound. He said Reynolds was shot in the chest. Williams said he didn't know what caused the free-for-all or who shot him.Fists and bullets started flying shortly before midnight Sunday during the bowling alley's Soul Bowl event, where about 160 people had gathered. The sound of gunfire sent the crowd running in all directions, police and witnesses said. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Police said Tuesday they had no suspects. Williams, who said he was shot in the collar bone, said he thought shots were fired both inside and outside the bowling alley. ""A fight broke out and the next thing you know shots just rung from everywhere,"" he said.Williams described Reynolds as a giving person who had a young son. ""I've known him almost my whole life,"" he said. ""I've been knowing him since I was 8 years old. We went to elementary school together.""Three other friends were shot as they tried to get out the front door, Williams said. A police report identified them as Jeffery Holland, 20; Dominique Mason, 24; and Vincenzo Happy, 23.Williams said Holland was shot in the leg, Mason was shot in the head and Happy was shot in the ribs. Kathy Johnson, a spokeswoman for University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital, said she did not have information on the conditions of any of those men Tuesday. Information on hospital patients involved in criminal cases is sometimes restricted.However, Williams said Holland and Happy were doing OK. Mason was in more serious condition and possibly suffered some brain damage, but was able to speak when he woke up from surgery Monday night, he said. Danny Collins, president of Collins Bowling Centers, which owns Eastland, said alley officials had decided to end the event after people began fighting inside. The shooting started as they were getting everybody out of the building, he said.Williams said he didn't know what people were fighting about, but he and Reynolds were trying to push their way through a crowd that had gathered around an altercation. They wanted to see who was fighting, ""to see if it was one of our friends,"" he said. About that time, they heard a gunshot and started heading for the front door, he said. They got shot near the doorway as gunfire erupted in the parking lot, he said.""We were not shooting. We were not fighting,"" he said. ""We were just trying to have a good time.""On Monday, Lexington police released a surveillance photo of a man they wanted to talk to about the shooting, but they had not identified him Tuesday, Lexington police Sgt. Pete Ford said.Ford said police had not determined how many people were shooting. He noted that the pandemonium made it difficult to gather evidence or find those involved. Few people had come forward with tips. ""We are waiting for information,"" he said. ""Due to the amount of the people that were there, we're sure someone has information that can help us.""Police called the incident an isolated event and said it should not reflect poorly on Eastland Bowling Lanes. Collins said it was the first time in the bowling alley's 50 years in business that such an incident had occurred. He said Eastland would no longer hold the Soul Bowl.HOW TO HELPAnyone with information is asked to contact the Lexington Division of Police at (859) 258-3600 or (859) 258-3700.

214,484333,"FEDERAL WAY, Wash. — Four people were killed by a man on a deadly rampage before he was shot and killed by police Sunday night at a Federal Way apartment complex, police said.According to police, the shootings took place shortly after 9:30 p.m. at the Pinewood Apartments in the 33300 block of 18th Lane South in Federal Way. Piecing together stories from witnesses and investigators, police believe the killings began with a domestic violence homicide and continued with the angry man walking outside and shooting those who confronted him.The incident started when the 28-year-old suspect shot his 25-year-old girlfriend in the back of the head in their shared apartment. The man then walked outside and encountered two men; a 46-year-old and a 24-year-old. Witnesses reported hearing yelling, and the suspect shot both men with a handgun, killing them. The younger man was shot in the back while attempting to run, police said, and witnesses said they saw the suspect “execute” the man once he fell to the ground.A neighbor in his early 60s walked outside his apartment when he heard the gunfire and saw the shootings. The man yelled for someone to call 911 and locked himself inside the apartment. Police said the suspect shot open the man’s door with a shotgun, entered the apartment and shot him in the stomach. The neighbor had no known contact with the man prior to the incident, police said.<a href=""https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/federal-way-shooting.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all""><img alt=""federal way shooting"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-27034"" height=""168"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"" src=""https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/federal-way-shooting.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;h=168"" srcset=""https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/federal-way-shooting.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;h=168 300w, https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/federal-way-shooting.jpg?w=597&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;h=336 597w, https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/federal-way-shooting.jpg?w=150&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;h=84 150w"" width=""300""/></a>The suspect had a record of prior verbal domestic disputes, and was known to carry firearms.

This happened in Washington State, so, wrong coastline. Nice try, though. It's not DC it's Washington State … you know … out here in the wild wild west. Why do people comment before reading the article?  First words – ""FEDERAL WAY, Wash.""  Duh.. I mean, really?   Doesn't matter how you cut it…..if the weapons used were illegal, the new gun laws would have done nothing to stop the shootings. If the weapons were legally obtained…..new laws would have also been ineffective.You are wrong. We need to get rid of ALL of the guns. If guns are outlawed, only Outlaws will have guns. Because we all need our Monday morning fix of gun violence to get us through the day….Wow, ""Buck"". You should shut the hell up if you don't know your US states What's going on with the stupid comments section here? Someone dissed or baby momma drama?  natural selection You wonder why it was 8 officers instead of 2 or 3? Paid Vacation! Well Buck my dear, you obviously can't read! Washington STATE is a far cry from  DC. The truth is that it doesn't matter WHAT state you live in, this most certainly CAN and DOES happen everywhere. Having moved from that exact area due to the influx of black and Mexican gangs and other criminal activity several years ago, I can tell you that it was most likely NOT legal guns and registered owners as well.  I had to make a hard decision to leave an are that i absolutely loved soon after the influx of an overwhelming amount of illegals from the Mexican border began taking over neighborhood after neighborhood in quick succession, in my area of Washington state. I moved first from Auburn, then to Federal Way, then again and again. It didn't matter where I moved too, the result was the same. Parking lots and children's playgrounds suddenly full of used Hypodermic needles, Used condoms, beer bottles (mostly broken) and other unsightly trash and no one willing to admit there was a Hugh problem, let alone try and figure out how, or even care about cleaning it all up.  Waking up to swat teams surrounding neighboring apartments, having the neighbors across the hall invaded by a SWAT team busting their 'Meth' lab, it all became too much for me and my young grandson in short order.  So I moved to south Texas where I now watch them come across the border daily. And by them, I am not speaking of just Mexican illegals although they do represent the largest number of illegals crossing the border unabated. There are also terrorists that cross daily and our lovely government does absolutely nothing about it but deny it…and our border patrol agents the ability to apprehend and return these illegal CRIMINALS. And yes, they ARE criminals! It is a felony to illegally enter this country just as it is to get lines of credit, buy vehicles, etc and they take them to Mexico  never paying off the loans and leaving taxpayers on the hook for it. You can't go to a community clinic these days because they are so filled to capacity with illegals that they are unable to take new patients. Our hospital ER'S are full of them camping out and picnicking on the floors of the waiting rooms while they wait for a child to be seen for a common cold because they know the hospital can't refuse to see them and they can get off without paying as opposed to seeing a regular doctor in an office like taxpayers are forced to do. And coincidentally, this creates a HUGH problem for REAL emergency patients who often are not seen in a timely manner or until after they have reached a critical point, or die waiting to be seen. We have a hugh problem in this country and it isn't LEGAL gun owners. The Ft. Hood, Boston Marathon, 911…all will continue to happen over and over again, with increasing frequency and devastation because our government simply refuses to admit we have the problem, and the media refuse to cover it as it doesn't fit their Progressive agenda. What is truly sad is that this government has also worked feverishly to divide the American public on much less important issues (all smoke screens for THEIR purposes) so that they can continue to deceive us as to the real problems in this country such as open borders, terrorists training camps in our country, etc. And yes, our government knows of the dozens of terrorist training camps linked to Al Queda in this country yet continue to do nothing about them just as they have done nothing for over 13 years about them in the first place. Until the American people wake up and start demanding answers of this government, and results, instead of listening to the 'safe' rhetoric that they hand us through the W. H. and the mass media, this country is on a hugh collision course. I only wish most of you could see what I see everyday. The illegal guns in this country aren't from Americans. They are from cartels and moose limb extremists who work together and struggle them into this country for the sol purpose of committing crimes against our citizens with them. It is pretty rare that LEGAL guns and their owners are the perpetrators of crime in this country. They amount to 1.5 % of ALL crime committed and that includes crimes that are often dismissed or left untried due to the fact that they were actually simply self protection AGAINST criminals trying to take the legal owners lives or property in the first place. And just for the record, your right. Chicago as well as DC have the strictest gun control laws in this country. What you obviously aren't aware of is the fact that they also have the HIGHEST crime rates in the country, and it isn't with legal guns either. This is big  load of total BS. Why move from Federal Way to the Texas? What a dumb move. Guns don't kill people.  People kill people.   the border is not secure thanks to democrat party ideology supporting open borders and now amnesty attempting to legitimize millions of illegal alien's many already on taxpayer funded social assistance while millions of American citizens have no jobs and no optimism of being hired anytime soon. these are the same partisan democrat party politician's trying to take American guns away from law abiding citizens under the guise of ""registration"". and another reason why the country is so divided. Not true.  You're joking! What town do you live in? Spanaway? Can anyone say GANGS ???? What ever happened to hard labor as a punishment for crime?  Was it too cruel and unusual?   Would you consider it cruel and unusual if someone physically attacked, raped, or killed you or a family member?  Does it matter if it was done with a gun, knife, car, baseball bat, or their bare hands? What is the deterrent to committing a violent crime if you know that you will have 3 meals a day and TV, books, education, and recreation?  Would the deterring factor be greater if you knew that you would be subject to a harsh work environment and conditions?  Establish and enforce strict rules and consequences for poor behavior while they are serving their sentences.  Put them up in tents with GPS locators and use shock collars or worse if they misbehave.  Reward good behavior with better conditions and benefits.  Meanwhile, they can work on road and other public works projects.  Run it like a business and this would cover the costs of their incarceration.  Inmates would also learn basic job skills to gain employment when they get out.  I'm sure we could save millions of dollars in the penal system this way.   Bring back hard labor for the members of society that do not respect the basic human rights of others. it is cruel and unusual for these people. they don't work. I live in federal way …. And its not just gangs here…. So befor you talk about a town find your facts out…. So, what is the real story? Yes, it's also prostitutes, enterprising solo drug dealers and illegals..

217,484333,"A     man who killed his girlfriend at their Federal Way apartment Sunday night and then killed three others before he was fatally shot by police may have been determined to leave no witnesses, police said.Federal Way Police Chief Brian Wilson   said the city’s deadliest shooting began as a domestic-violence homicide around 9:35 p.m. when the gunman shot his 25-year-old girlfriend in the head in their apartment at Pinewood Village in the 33300 block of 18th Lane South. The 27-year-old gunman then left the apartment with a duffle bag of his belongings and headed to the parking lot, Wilson said. There he encountered   two men, 23 and 46, who were standing next to a car. Wilson said police do not know what, if anything, the two men said to the gunman, but witnesses reported hearing shouting and yelling before both men were shot.Police said witnesses told them that the shooter “executed” one of the men. One died next to the car, and the other was shot in the back as he tried to run away, police said. As shots were fired, resident James Mack, 63, said he and a neighbor opened their doors to see what was happening.Mack said the neighbor ran up a small flight of stairs to look out into the parking lot, then he ran back down and told Mack to call 911. Both men went back into their apartments, Mack said.“I saw him go into his apartment and we both closed our doors,” Mack said. “Next thing I know, I hear more gunshots. I looked through my peephole and saw a man I didn’t recognize leaving his apartment.”Wilson said the gunman used a shotgun blast to breach the door of Mack’s 62-year-old neighbor’s apartment and then killed him with a second shot.Mack said he believes the gunman may have tried to kill him as well. There were 15 bullet holes on the walls outside his apartment, though it wasn’t immediately clear if any came from responding police. “We believe he may have been trying to kill his witnesses,” Wilson, the police chief, said of the gunman.Responding officers heard gunshots as they began arriving at the complex, said Federal Way police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock. They found the   armed man in a stairwell, where officers ordered him to drop his shotgun, but he “did not comply,” Wilson said.Police opened fire, wounding the gunman and causing him to drop the shotgun. But he ran from the stairwell and headed back into the parking lot before falling to the ground near one of the two men he had shot earlier, Wilson said.That’s where police found him and again ordered him to surrender. However, the officers said they opened fire when he reached for a gun that was on the ground nearby, Wilson said.After the suspect was killed, police made a door-by-door search of the complex and found his girlfriend and the 62-year-old victim, police said. <b>Carry permit and domestic-violence reports</b>Though police have not released the gunman’s name, a law-enforcement source identified him as Dennis Clark III.Clark’s grandmother, Lillie Johnson, 73, of Renton, said Monday that“He was no violent person,” she said. “He got along with everybody. He wasn’t violent at all.” Johnson said she last spoke to her grandson three weeks to a month ago, and that she had not talked to Clark’s mother since Christmas.His father, she said, left when Clark was a baby.Her grandson grew up in Seattle and called her regularly, she said.“He was always happy calling me, telling me he loved me,” Johnson said.He made a point of saying he was trying to stay out of trouble and telling her how he was doing in school, she said.“Laughing and talking, and just make your day,” Johnson added.The gunman was armed with a .40-caliber semi-automatic handgun and a pistol-grip shotgun, Wilson said.
He said the gunman had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and was the registered owner of at least two firearms, including the handgun he used to kill the first three victims. The history of the shotgun used to kill the fourth victim was being investigated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Wilson said.Although police said the shooter did not have a criminal history, he had been reported to police in Seattle and Federal Way for domestic violence involving verbal abuse.Wilson said preliminary records indicate there was no cause to arrest the gunman on the previous reports of domestic violence because there were no allegations of assault. He also said that the victim killed Sunday evening was not the victim in either of the earlier reports.Clark and his slain girlfriend had formerly lived in a Kent apartment complex but moved about a year ago, according to an apartment manager.
A total of eight officers fired their weapons during the confrontations with the man, said Schrock. All have been placed on administrative leave, per standard policy, as the investigation continues.No officers were injured.One of the dead was identified as Ceasar Valdovinos, 23, according to family members who said police confirmed the young man’s death Monday morning. The names of the other three people were not released Monday by the King County Medical Examiner’s Office.<b>Mistaken for fireworks<br/>
</b>Residents of the apartments and some neighbors said the incident is out of character for the complex.Jennifer Brown, 37, who has lived in the apartment complex with her husband, two sons and a daughter for three years, said she went out on their porch about 9:30 p.m. to smoke a cigarette.“That’s when I heard the first round. I thought it was firecrackers at first because it was an awful lot of them,” she said. A few moments later she heard several more shots, and then her 14-year-old son saw a man in the street running from the complex.Police arrived in about 10 minutes, and Brown heard them tell people to get back into their apartments.“I could hear a police officer over a speaker say, ‘Stop or we’ll shoot. Get down.’ They said it over and over.”She then heard another burst of gunfire.“I’ve seen police activities out on the streets, but nothing to this extent,” she said of her time at the apartments. “The apartments are actually pretty safe. But after this, I definitely want to move.”<b>“I heard pop, pop, pop, pop”</b>Sunday night was Jane Friedman’s first night as a resident of the apartment complex.“I can’t believe it. I’m in shock. This was my first night here,” said Friedman, who said she had just sold a family farm near Enumclaw.“I was in my bedroom and I heard pop, pop, pop, pop. Then, pop, pop, pop, pop.”Soon, she said, “There were police officers all over the place. They said get back into your apartments. We have someone running around with a gun.”She then heard more shots, but did not go out to investigate, and learned of the deaths only when she went out to talk with reporters Monday.“It’s absolutely devastating.”Kristina Braun, 23, said she and her husband and 3-year-old daughter had gone to the movies and dinner Sunday, arriving home about 9:30 p.m.“We saw and heard a ton of ambulances and police cars everywhere,” she said Monday.She and her family were still awaiting an OK from police Monday morning before they could return to their apartment. “It’s actually really calm, normally … This is the first huge issue,” said Braun, who’s lived in the complex for two years. She said about six months ago, a lot of police responded to a robbery at a nearby grocery.<b>“Gunshots. Lots of gunshots”</b>Sung Yang, who runs a motel nearby, said he and residents heard the gunfire.“I heard gunshots. Lot of gunshots. It was scary,” Yang said.There was a series of shots at first and then after about 10 minutes, more shooting, he said.Kelly Burki, a resident of the complex, said Monday morning,“I’ve lived here five and a half or six years, and I’ve never had a problem. I just don’t understand it.”Burki, 51, had been out for the evening and was returning home about 11 p.m. to find her street closed by police.
Burki said she is a bartender who frequently doesn’t get home until around 2:30 a.m. “But even at that hour, I’ve always felt safe. I’ve never had fear.”Wilson, the police chief, said Sunday’s shootings resulted in the largest loss of life in a single incident in the city’s history. The city of about 91,000 residents had three homicides in 2012 and one in 2011.<em>Seattle Times staff reporters Sara Jean Green, Steve Miletich and Alexa Vaughn and news researcher Gene Balk contributed to this report.</em>

Gumms, an 18-year-old Terrytown resident who has two eyes tattooed on the back of his neck, has been booked with being a principal to attempted second-degree murder in the April 22 attack, when two men armed with an assault rifle and a pistol stood outside an apartment door in the A The ""They changed their stories and pointed their fingers at each other,"" Eserman testified Friday during a preliminary hearing in 24th Judicial District Court in Gretna.Gumms remains jailed in Gretna with suspects Frankie Hoofkin, 21, of Waggaman, Lashawn Davis, 20, of the Gretna area and Davante Robertson, 19, of Terrytown.The public defenders representing them argued Friday that the evidence was insufficient to continue holding them in jail. But after hearing Eserman's testimony, Magistrate Commissioner Patricia Joyce found that the Sheriff's Office has sufficient evidence, or probable cause, to keep the four men in custody. The investigation is not over, and it remains to be seen when, or if, prosecutors file charges.Hoofkin was booked with five counts of attempted second-degree murder and aggravated flight from an officer, for being the driver who led deputies and state Department of Public Safety bridge police on a chase from the shooting scene across the Crescent City Connection into downtown New Orleans. He crashed the car at the Earhart Boulevard exit, where he was injured after falling or jumping off the exit ramp to the ground below. He appeared in court Friday in a wheelchair, his left arm in a cast.Gumm, Davis and Robertson are being held on five counts each of being a principal to attempted second-degree murder. Eserman's testimony suggested that the identity of the second gunman has not been determined.Davis also was injured at the crash scene, where a ""police dog chewed on him,"" public defender Paul Fleming Jr. said. Gumms and Robertson were found hiding nearby in bushes, Eserman testified.Hoofkin's three friends identified him as the owner of the assault rifle and one of the shooters. Depending on which suspect was talking, the second gunman was Robertson or Gumms, Eserman said.""We have everybody saying somebody got out of the car with Hookfin,"" Assistant District Attorney Vince Paciera said, arguing that all four suspects were arrested together.Authorities say the ground outside the apartment was littered with 7.62mm bullet casings, commonly used in assault rifles, and two .40-caliber bullet casings. That suggests two gunmen.Eserman said Sheriff's Office ballistics experts have linked the assault rifle, found in Hookfin's car, to the 7.62mm casings at the apartment. The .40-caliber pistol has not been found, Eserman said, but deputies recovered a 9mm pistol from a roadway after one of the suspects threw it from the car.Fingerprint tests are pending, he said. He conceded under questioning from defense attorneys that gunshot residue tests were not done on the suspects.At the time of the shooting, sheriff's deputies and an FBI agent were at the neighboring Helen Cox High School campus, waiting for a suspect in a different crime to show up. They heard the gunfire and saw two men running from the apartments to a car, whose driver then sped off, Eserman testified.A Sheriff's Office spokesman has said previously that authorities think the shooting came in retaliation for an incident at a New Orleans bar. Eserman provided no testimony Friday on what detectives think was the motivePaciera said Davis has ""a bad juvenile history"" that includes convictions of simple battery and simple burglary and an arrest in 2011 on a charge of second-degree murder. He pleaded guilty as a juvenile in 2009 to attempted second-degree murder and also is being held for a parole violation.Robertson pleaded guilty in 2007 to attempted armed robbery and has an arrest for disturbing the peace for causing ""a major fight"" at his school, as well as an arrest for possession of marijuana in 2011, Paciera said.

227,485746,"Alcus SmithRobert WilliamsAlcus SmithRobert WilliamsJurors heard opening statements Thursday in the trial of two West Bank men, one of whom prosecutors say was the leader of the Harvey Hustlers street gang and the other a key player in its drug distribution network.The Prosecutors say gang members brought huge quantities of cocaine from Houston to the Scottsdale area of Harvey for the better part of a decade.Jefferson Parish Assistant District Attorney Doug Freese told jurors that testimony will show Robert “Little Rob” Williams, the alleged leader of the Harvey Hustlers gang, took part in a cocaine deal with co-defendant Alcus “Bug” Smith at a Manhattan Boulevard daiquiri shop in 2013 and orchestrated a botched hit on a rival gang member that left two women and three children shot in their home, among other charges.In addition to the drug deal he is accused of conducting with Williams, Smith is alleged to have taken part in the killing of Donte Hall, who was Many of the witnesses expected to testify have pleaded guilty in state and federal courts to racketeering and other charges, and Williams’ and Smith’s attorneys told jurors their clients are being set up by men trying to pin the blame on anyone but themselves.“Most of these individuals will have a reason not to tell the truth,” said Eddie Jordan Jr., who represents Williams. “They are looking for a break; they are looking for a deal.”Jordan told jurors they will not be able to find Williams was the leader of a crime syndicate because investigators found no money and no real estate, two things that typically define a drug kingpin.Matthew Goetz, who represents Smith, said his client isn’t a member of the Harvey Hustlers, never got out of his car at the daiquiri shop the day of the alleged drug deal and is not even accused of possessing drugs anywhere in Jefferson Parish.He said there is no evidence Smith had a beef with Hall, and the witness who will testify about Hall’s murder was a suspect who concocted a story to save himself.Prosecutors say Smith ran a separate enterprise, with associates in Dallas and Houston, that effectively merged with the Hustlers as a part of their drug dealing.Freese told jurors many of the witnesses were co-conspirators because of the nature of the organization and its criminal activities, but the fact they are seeking lower sentences in return for their testimony doesn’t necessarily mean they aren’t telling the truth.“These are not good guys,” he acknowledged. “They are not going to make your Christmas card list.”Williams is charged with racketeering; distribution of cocaine; two counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, heroin and marijuana; and three counts related to illegally possessing a stolen firearm as a felon.Smith is charged with second-degree murder, racketeering, distribution of cocaine and two counts of conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine and marijuana.Others indicted in state court were Brandon Motton, Carlnell Pierce, Charles D.

</div></div></div></div>DOWNTOWN JACKSON — A man convicted of two charges in connection with a 2013 double murder was sentenced on Monday afternoon.   Travontay Berry was sentenced after being found guilty on Feb. 19.  For the crime of carrying a firearm for purpose of going armed, Berry was ordered to serve 11 months and 29 days and pay a $2,500 fine. For the tampering with evidence charge, Berry was ordered to serve 4 years and has to pay a $5,000 fine.  Those terms must be served consecutively.   During the early morning hours of April 28, 2013, police were called to a shooting at Wolfe Enterprises at 438 E. Main Street.   Officers arrived to find Brian Banes and Delandis Clark, both 31 and of Jackson, with apparent gunshot wounds. They were transported to Jackson-Madison County General Hospital where they were later pronounced dead.   Two other gunshot victims arrived at the hospital via personal vehicles. The investigation determined there was an argument on the parking lot as a party was letting out. Berry was allegedly the first person to fire a semi-automatic handgun into the air while he was standing in a crowd of people. Anthony Montrell Swift, of Jackson, is accused of shooting Banes and Clark multiple times.   After the shootings, police said that Berry left the scene and disposed of the weapon that he fired.  Swift is charged with the murder of Brian Banes and Delandis Clark and is awaiting trial.<div class=""vc_row row wpb_row vc_row row-fluid row-fluid""><div class=""right-rail wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 col-sm-12""><div class=""vc_column-inner ""><div class=""wpb_wrapper"">

The jury deliberated for about a half hour before returning with the verdict on the reckless endangerment and tampering with evidence charges.  On April 28 around 3:05 a.m., police were called to a shooting at Wolfe Enterprises at 438 E. Main Street. Officers arrived to find Banes and Clark, both 31, of Jackson, with apparent gunshot wounds. They were transported to Jackson-Madison County General Hospital where they were later pronounced dead. Two other gunshot victims arrived at the hospital via personal vehicles.   The investigation determined there was an argument on the parking lot of 438 E. Main Street as a party was letting out. Berry was allegedly the first person to fire a semi-automatic handgun into the air while he was standing in a crowd of people.   Anthony Montrell Swift, of Jackson, is accused of shooting Brian Banes and Delandis Clark multiple times. After the shootings, police said that Berry left the scene and disposed of the weapon that he fired.   Swift will be on trial on March 25.<div class=""vc_row row wpb_row vc_row row-fluid row-fluid""><div class=""right-rail wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12 col-sm-12""><div class=""vc_column-inner ""><div class=""wpb_wrapper"">

            By <strong>By <a href=""mailto:jqueally@starledger.com"">James Queally</a> and <a href=""mailto:tdinges@starledger.com"">Tomas Dinges</a>/The Star-Ledger</strong><a href=""http://www.nj.com/newark"">NEWARK</a>The sources, who were not at liberty to discuss the investigation publicly, said friends of the man who died in the early Thursday morning accident had gathered at South 16th Street for a vigil.Several people in the group began arguing and shots rang out a short lime later, the sources said. Police said the shots were fired just after 10 p.m.Neighbors said the all-day gathering outside on the street involved alcohol — and kids were outside, too.It was not clear early today whether the shooter was carrying the gun during the vigil or left and came back with the weapon. Police said the shooter apparently exited a dark-colored vehicle, fired several shots, got back in the car, and fled.The five injured people were taken to area hospitals where they were all listed in stable condition - and four were released by noon today, police said. The 10-year-old girl was shot in the ankle, a 22-year-old woman was shot in the buttocks, a 46-year-old woman and 25-year-old man were shot in the arm, and a 48-year-old man was wounded in both legs.No arrests have been made.People were drinking alcohol on the street all day, and there were kids around during that time, said one neighbor.""They were out there drinking all day long — that's probably what heated the whole thing up,"" said Millie Rivera, a neighbor who moved to the street last August — and plans to move out in July.<big><big><big><strong>CONNECT WITH US </strong></big> </big></big><big>• Like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Star.Ledger"">The Star-Ledger</a> on Facebook</big>• Follow <em>And check out our <strong>redesigned mobile site</strong> by visiting <strong>NJ.com</strong> from any mobile browser. </em>The vigil was for a man who had died in a single-vehicle crash some six blocks away on Clinton Place, the sources said.The driver of the vehicle had apparently lost control of the car at 4 a.m. Thursday, and struck a residence at 19 Clinton Place, said city police spokesman Sgt. Ronald Glover. The unidentified man was rushed to University Hospital where he later died from his injuries.The exact circumstances surrounding the accident were unclear, said Glover early Thursday.On South 16th Street, a person this morning shouted out at reporters who had gathered.""It was my family!"" he shouted. ""Get... up out my house. You only come out here when something happens.""We're killing each other out here!"" he added.Neighbors on the street said there has been a run of local crime in recent years — robberies, thefts, shootings and a stabbing - which has changed the neighborhood. Several abandoned houses are scattered along the street.""My family's been here 40 years,"" said Dwayne Morris. ""This used to be a beautiful block.""""This is a crazy block,"" Rivera said. ""That's why I'm moving off the street. In July.""Police said they're still in the very early stages of the investigation into the shooting, and have not identified a motive or a suspect.

255,486056,"EAST PALO ALTO (CBS SF) — Five people were shot and a young girl was injured in East Palo Alto Sunday after gunshots were fired into a crowd of people at a bus stop near a McDonald’s restaurant, according to fire officials.The incident was reported around 2:45 p.m. at a bus stop in front of the McDonald’s at 2401 University Avenue, according to Menlo Park Fire Department Chief Harold Shapelhouman. Police said a pair of shooters opened fire on the crowd, but there was no indication yet as to why.Firefighters arriving on the scene found the victims – four inside the restaurant and two outside, but it is unclear where they were shot, Schapelhouman said. It’s believed the victims ran inside the restaurant for help.Police were still sorting out the details late Sunday, but Capt. John Cook of the East Palo Alto Police Department did describe the scene to reporters:“Approximately at 2:46 this afternoon, the shot spotter was activated, plus we had several calls from citizens about gunshots in the area at University and Bay, right by the bus stop and McDonald’s. There were four Hispanic young males there at the time, a grandmother, and a young granddaughter, approximately, 6-years-old. So five people were injured by gunshots, not life-threatening. The little girl was injured, but that was because she fell when she tried to run away,” he said.Evidence markers were strewn across the street of the scene, likely marking expended shell casings from the gunfire. Police are also questioning witnesses who may have seen what happened. Early reports indicated at least one victim, a man in his 20s, suffered serious injuries.Most of the gunshot wounds were to the lower extremities, Schapelhouman said.All the victims were taken to Stanford Medical Center for treatment.(Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

Five people were shot and a 6-year-old girl was injured in East Palo Alto on Sunday afternoon near a McDonald's on University Avenue, according to police.The shootings were picked up by the ShotSpotter gunshot detection system, and several residents called 911 shortly after 2:45 p.m. The incident occurred near a bus stop on Bay Road adjacent to the west side of a Four young Hispanic males and a grandmother police also described as Hispanic waiting near the SamTrans bus shelter were shot and received non-life-threatening injuries. The child was injured after falling as she ran away, he said. The grandmother and child are not associated with the other victims, he said. All six were taken to Stanford Hospital for treatment.The shooter is a young Hispanic male who fired from a smaller early 90s vehicle, possibly a gray or silver car, which police called a vehicle of interest.Cooks said in an earlier interview that two males are being sought.The small car approached from northbound Bay Road. The car stopped directly in front of the bus stop, then several shots were fired at the victims from the inside of the vehicle.Police are currently assessing video from nearby businesses, Cook said. The Cinco de Mayo Day shootings follow a Saturday night incident, in which a man was shot in the torso on Pulgas Street.  Cook said the vehicle in that shooting appears to be larger and  different.Cook said he did not know how many shots were fired, but some casings were found on Gloria Way.Police from Palo Alto and Menlo Park also arrived on scene and cordoned off Bay Road and McDonald's from University Avenue to Gloria Way. Menlo Park firefighters arrived on scene to treat the victims, finding some inside the McDonald's and some outside. Cook said all were shot outside, but two ran into the restaurant after being struck. No one was injured inside.Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said most of the injuries were to the victims' lower extremities. One man in his 20s had more serious injuries.CommentsThat's obviously awful.  Pray for peace and no more violence.<span style=""background-color:#CCCCCC;color:white;width:70px;display:block;text-align:center;float:left;"">Reply</span> This behavor is completely reprehensible.

This place is turning into a of war place.and the winners are the bad guys, who get away and nothing is done. There is not enough police here in E. P. A.

Thats why they dont speak up to the police.  THe Justice system required that a witness show up in court in person to testify against a person charged with commiting a crime.  These animals have their family and criminal friends show up in court and see who is testifying against their friend and they go find them in the community and terrorize and kill them or their family.  The police cant protect them.   That is why people don't speak up.  If you lived in a place like that you would probably do the same.  Untill the police can protect the witnesses to a point where people won't feel threatened for speaking out, it will stay the same.  The only time people will speak up is if they witness something that happened to their own family. <span style=""background-color:#CCCCCC;color:white;width:70px;display:block;text-align:center;float:left;"">Reply</span> @XDM: Thanks for the scoop - it makes complete sense.<span style=""background-color:#CCCCCC;color:white;width:70px;display:block;text-align:center;float:left;"">Reply</span> These are babies!

""children do have a way of expressing anger"", let's give our teens a chance to express their inner thoughts and see where we can help dissolve or put out the flame that is burning in these kid's hearts.

Discuss as:Gunfire erupted at a parade to celebrate Mother's Day, injuring 19, including two 10-year-old kids. Police are searching for three people seen running from the scene. NBC's Gabe Gutierrez reports.  At least 19 people were injured on Sunday when multiple gunmen opened fire on a Mother’s Day parade in New Orleans, police said.A 10-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl were grazed by bullets but were in good condition, New Orleans Police spokesman Garry Flot said in a statement. A woman and a man were in surgery Sunday evening, but there were no fatalities and most wounds were not life threatening, police said.At least three people were spotted running away from the scene after the shooting on North Villere Street in the 7th Ward neighborhood at 1:45 p.m. At least one suspect was described as a man between the ages of 18 and 22.New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas said there may have been as many as three shooters, and that two different types of weapons were likely used.The victims were marching in what is known as a second line parade, which are common in New Orleans: A brass band plays while marching in the streets, while a “second line” of people follows the band, celebrating.Officials said the parade was two blocks long and included about 400 people. The crime scene was about 1.5 miles from the heart of the French Quarter and  near the Treme neighborhood, which has been the centerpiece for the HBO TV  series ""Treme.""“These are unusual circumstances. We have second lines which occur in the city of New Orleans virtually every weekend at this time of the year,” Serpas said.  “We had a full complement of police officers. It appears that these two or three people just for a reason unknown to us, started shooting at towards, or in the crowd. It was over in just a couple seconds.”Lauren Mcgaughy / The Times-Picayune / LandovBystanders comfort a shooting victim after gunfire injured 19 people during a Mother's Day in New Orleans on Sunday.Mayor Mitch Landrieu said the shooting was part of ""the relentless drum beat of  violence"" on the streets of New Orleans.""It’s a shame and its got to stop,"" he told Detectives were conducting interviews and retrieving surveillance video from around the scene.  Landrieu urged anyone with information about the shooting to come forward.He added: ""These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered. Somebody knows something. The  way to stop this violence is for you all to help.""Second lines have been targets for violence in New Orleans in recent years. In the past, shooters have targeted a specific person in the crowd, which authorities say may have been the case Sunday as well.  But Landrieu dismissed the notion of outlawing the Louisiana tradition.“It’s not the second line that did the shooting,” he said. “The cultural events are very important to us, it’s like calling for an end to Mardi Gras because someone takes an opportunity to shoot someone during one of our parades.”  “Second lines have been with us for a long, long time,” Landrieu added. “They are an important part of our culture and our heritage.”Mary Beth Romig, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New Orleans, told The Associated Press that federal  investigators have no indication that the shooting was an act of terrorism.""It's strictly an act of street violence in New Orleans,"" she said. <em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em> "

New Orleans Mother's Day parade hit by shooting






"
276,486209,"New Orleans police have a clearer picture -- literally -- of who they are looking for in connection with the shooting that wounded 19 people at a Mother's Day second line in the Seventh Ward.The New Orleans Police Department released surveillance video of the shooting early Monday morning. It shows a man approaching a large crowd and firing numerous shots, then leaving the scene.<a href=""http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/nopd-releases-video-of-suspect-in-mothers-day-shooting/20119776"" target=""_blank"">Watch video</a>Mayor Mitch Landrieu has called for witnesses to step forward and help solve what has become one of the worst shootings in years in the city of New Orleans.Many of the wounded remained hospitalized on Monday -- some recovering from serious injuries.The gunman -- or gunmen -- opened fire on a second line taking place in the 7th Ward on Mother's Day afternoon. The toll increased steadily throughout the day, with initial reports of ""several"" injuries, then a dozen.The victims include 10 adult men, 7 adult women, a 10-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy, police said. At least four people were in surgery mid-afternoon and patients had been taken to four area hospitals.Remarkably, no one was expected to die from their injuries.New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Ronal Serpas said one of the shooters appeared to be a dark-skinned man, 18-22 years old, with short hair and wearing a white shirt and blue jean shorts. The person seen on the surveillance video fit that description.""These kinds of incidents are not going to go unanswered,"" Landrieu said Sunday evening at an impromptu news conference at LSU Interim Hospital. ""We're going to be very aggressive. There were hundreds of people out there today, so somebody knows who did this and the way we're going to stop the violence together in the city is for everybody to come together, and we really need help.""The group which organized the parade, The Original Big 7 Social Aid and Pleasure Club, released a statement Monday on its Facebook page.The group expressed its gratitude and thanks to all those who expressed support, love and concern following the shooting.“We are praying for all the families affected by this senseless violence yesterday,” the release said.The release called the crime an outrage to what the second lining culture represents.""Second lining is about community and celebration, not trauma and violence,” said the statement. “Yesterday’s shooting was in no way a product of second line culture or somehow set in motion by the parade or its route, as some critics may suggest. Our parade brings together different folks from across the city – black, white, Latino, the young and the old, and lots of families – to celebrate the best of New Orleans. We feel embarrassed that the world is now viewing our city and our community through a lens of violence. We support a thorough investigation of the shooting and pray the perpetrators will be brought to justice.”Landrieu has called the entire community to participate in a Community Response at the site of Sunday's shooting, Frenchmen and N. Villere streets.

    Desair Brown hosts USA NOW for May 13, 2013, covering shootings taking place in New Orleans, including the most recent incident at a Mother's Day parade.
    Second-line parades are loose processions in which people dance down the street, often following a brass band. They can be impromptu or planned and are sometimes described as moving block parties.The parade included police officers and was about two blocks long, police said.""When the end of the parade reached North Villere and Frenchmen ... shots were fired from different guns,'' Flot  said in a statement. ""Immediately after the shooting our officers saw three suspects running from the scene.''Shermaine Tyler, 32, who lives nearby, told ""Me and mom were going to the second line. I told her I didn't want to go because there are always shots at a second line,"" Tyler said. ""And the second I heard shots, I heard shots fired, we ran outside and one man fell in my lap who had been shot.""A social club called The Original Big 7 organized Sunday's event. The group was founded in 1996 at a housing project, according to its MySpace page.The neighborhood where the shooting happened was a mix of low-income and middle-class row houses, some boarded up. As of last year, the neighborhood's population was about 60% of its level before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005.<iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/BYwDHfAJhic?rel=0"" width=""560"">      &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;    </iframe><i><i>Contributing: Alia E.

            By <a href=""mailto:agrimm@nola.com"" id=""byline__authorEmailLink"" title=""Email Andy Grimm, NOLA.com"">agrimm@nola.com</a> Times-PicayuneTwo men who opened fire during Brothers Akein ""Keemy"" Scott and Shawn ""Shizzle"" Scott entered guilty pleas to racketeering and conspiracy charges, as well as counts related to a total of five shootings they committed as members of ""FnD,"" a street gang that took its name from the intersection of the Frenchmen and Derbigny streets.<a href=""http://topics.nola.com/tag/mother's%20day%20shootings/posts.html"">The Mother's Day shooting</a>The brothers entered their pleas standing alongside a third brother, 23-year-old Stanley ""Stizzle"" Scott, in U.S. District Judge Ivan Lemelle's courtroom. Each of the three face 20 years to life in prison when they are sentenced in January.Their joint plea deals with prosecutors do not require them to testify against the lone FnD member still facing trial, their older brother, Travis ""Trap"" Scott, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Payne said. Travis Scott is set to go to trial next month as the alleged leader of FnD.New Orleans Police say Akein Scott, 22, and Shawn Scott, 26, took up positions on opposite sides of Frenchmen Street as the May 12, 2013 parade passed near North Villere Street, and opened fire at a rival gang member, identified in court records by the initials ""J.T.""The melee was retaliation for a prior shooting that wounded Stanley Scott by members of the Prieur and Columbus Boys, a rival gang also known as ""PCB,"" police said.Nineteen bystanders were wounded, including J.T., who was struck five times, according to court records filed along with Akein, Stanley and Shawn Scott's guilty pleas. Another person was trampled as panicked parade-goers fled the shooting.Prosecutors allege FnD members trafficked heroin and crack cocaine in the 7th Ward dating back to 2006. Nine FnD members, most of them members of the Scott family, were charged in a federal indictment in 2014.Surveillance video showed the densely packed crowd along the parade route scattering amid the gunshots, images that shocked even city residents accustomed to occasional outbreaks of violence along parade routes.Among the those struck by bullets were two 10-year-old children, who suffered graze wounds. The shooter shown in the video, according to court records, was then 20-year-old Akein Scott.In the weeks that followed, organizers hosted a ""do over"" of the parade and multiple fundraisers were held for the injured even as police conducted a manhunt for the shooting suspects.In court records, FnD members who have pleaded guilty have admitted to selling drugs over a territory bounded by Elysian Fields Avenue, North Johnson, Interstate 10, St. Anthony Street and North Claiborne Avenue.The center of the gang's operation was the Frenchmen Meat Market, where workers would hold guns behind the counter for FnD members, and would let patrons swap food stamps for cash that they then handed over to FnD members for heroin or crack.Surveillance video from the store's own cameras was noted as evidence prosecutors intended to use at trial, with footage showing FnD members making numerous drug deals inside the store.Travis Scott often carried an AK-47 rifle he called ""monkey nuts,"" a reference to the massive drum magazine that could hold 100 rounds, according to court records. Akein Scott, now 22, sold drugs at the store several days a week, mostly in the afternoon after returning from school, one unnamed witness said in court records. As one of the younger members of the gang, Akein often was told to hang onto firearms for older gang members, because as a juvenile, he would face less serious penalties from authorities if he was caught with the weapons.In court records, Akein Scott admitted to pulling the trigger himself in four shootings during the year before the 2013 Mother's Day parade, joining Shawn and Stanley Scott in a shootout in front of the Frenchmen Meat Market in which a 14-year-old girl riding in a passing vehicle was shot in the leg. On Mother's Day 2013, Akein Scott is seen on surveillance video as the second-line parade moves down the block, stepping out from the side of a building with a pistol raised and firing into the terrified marchers, according to court records.When asked about his background by Judge Lemelle on Wednesday, Akein Scott was the only one of the brothers to have completed high school, stating that he attended college in ""Talladega"" and studied business administration. His lawyer, Julie Tizzard, said Akein Scott had been enrolled in college when he was arrested in 2014.<em>Stay with NOLA.com for more on this developing story.</em>

They were all taken to The MED by ambulance. Chaffin was pronounced dead at the hospital.A fourth victim was taken to The MED by a private vehicle.

They sifted through surveillance video and searched for more evidence following the deadly shooting.Survivor Chris Watts is fresh out of the hospital one day after the incident. A bullet wound is through his calf.""I was just standing over there, sitting on the stoop,"" said Watts. ""Shots went off ... I hit the ground ... Felt like somebody punched me in the leg. I was hoping that was the only one, and prayed to God. Blessed that it was the only one.""He said it sounded like the Fourth of July.Only instead of a celebration, witnesses said the Wild West broke out in a courtyard.""All these kids around, this stuff is ridiculous around here. They need to stop this stuff. This don't make sense,"" said neighbor C.C Walton.Neighbors said a feud over a man escalated to the point that a woman stepped out onto a balcony and started shooting.Other guns came out, bullets whizzing in all directions.Innocent bystanders were hit near the laundry room. Chaffin and Benson both died as a result.Two others who got shot are recovering, including Watts. Watts has no idea who shot him.""I wasn't trying to see.

FLINT, MI -- A Flint man was found not guilty of first-degree murder and assault in the fatal shooting a 20-year-old woman and the injury of a second woman that caused her to have a miscarriage.Jurors found Antonio King Green not guilty March 27 of Green, however, was found guilty following a more than week-long trial of three counts of assault with intent to murder, carrying a concealed weapon and felony firearm.Darnisha Oaks, 20, Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said his office argued that the shooting occurred as part of an ongoing feud between Green and the victims.Leyton said the shooting created a chaotic scene that may have involved multiple people firing shots. This chaos likely contributed to the fact prosecutors were unable to obtain a witness who saw Green shoot Oaks, Leyton said.The prosecutor added that witnesses told varying accounts of the incident.""I think the jury did a good job,"" Leyton said, adding that the case will remain under investigation.Green's attorney, Glenn Cotton, could not be reached for comment on the verdict.Genesee Circuit Judge Judith Fullerton is scheduled to sentence Green on April 27. He faces up to life in prison. <a href=""https://members.mlive.com/index.aspx?siteCode=MI"">Newspaper</a>

308,486998,"HAMPTON — Hampton Commonwealth's Attorney Anton Bell told a crowd of close to 200 about the arrest at a candlelight vigil held for Davis on Monday evening in the Hampton Coliseum parking lot.""This young man was killed senselessly,"" said Steven Brown, a community organizer and friend of the Davis family. ""We will not wait for the next big event to happen, and we will not forget what happened here. This violence needs to stop.""A 15-year-old male and 17-year-old male were arrested and each charged with one count of murder, four counts of maiming and five counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, according to Hampton Police.Police did not release the names of those suspects.Friends and family described Davis as an outgoing young man who loved his family.""There are so many of you I don't know, and many of you that I do,"" said Dawn Moses, the victim's aunt. ""Ralph touched so many lives.""Jay Brooks teaches at Bethel High School where Davis took a class last semester called algebra functions and data analysis. The teacher described Davis as a student who tried his hardest and who wasn't overly boisterous in class.""He was a quiet kid, although he did have a couple friends in class,"" Brooks said.Brown and other speakers described youth violence as a disease spreading throughout the community.Investigators accused the suspects of shooting at a group of teenagers during an argument near the Hampton Coliseum Spring Carnival.Emergency responders found Davis, of Hampton, suffering from a gunshot wound to his upper torso shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday. He was lying in the road in the 1900 block of Coliseum Drive when paramedics arrived.Davis was transported to a local hospital and pronounced dead at 11:14 p.m.The four other victims were found in parking lots of nearby hotels, according to police.Organizers have since canceled the carnival. The event had been scheduled to continue through June 2.A 14-year-old male who was shot in the back had improved from critical condition to stable, Hampton police spokesman Jason Price said Monday evening.An 18-year-old male from Hampton and a 17-year-old male from Newport News both suffered gunshot wounds to their legs. A 16-year-old female from Newport News suffered a gunshot wound to her ankle. All three were treated and released from the hospital shortly after the incident.In 2012, shots were fired as the carnival was closing, although no one was injured, according to police.Monday evening's vigil was organized by Best Kept Secret, a non-violence organization based in Newport News.Anyone with information that will assist police is encouraged to contact the Hampton Police Division at 727-6111 or Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP."
309,486998,"HAMPTON — Just before a shooting that killed one teen and wounded four others outside a Hampton carnival in late May, one teenage male dared another to shoot.Two groups of teens were jawing with each other outside the Hampton Coliseum Spring Carnival that Saturday night, when one teen pulled out a handgun.""If you're gonna show the gun, shoot it,"" a teenage male in the other group challenged the gun-wielding teen, according to testimony at a preliminary hearing Tuesday in Hampton Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court.Within seconds, according to a witness on the scene that day, the teen with the gun opened fire. The shooting killed Ralphael Davis Jr., 16 — who was not the one who dared the gunman — and left four other teens — ages 14, 16, 17 and 18 — injured.The shooting also spurred Hampton decision-makers to shut down the rest of the carnival, held during Memorial Day weekend, and spurred a candlelight vigil against youth violence in the city.Two Hampton teenagers, Ryan Taybron, 15, and Eric Nixon, 17, face murder charges in Davis' death, as well as several malicious wounding charges in the injuries to the others.On Tuesday, Judge Robert Wilson found that prosecutors had established probable cause in the case, certifying the charges and sending them to a grand jury in Circuit Court.As the hearing began, Commonwealth's Attorney Anton Bell made a motion asking Wilson to clear the courtroom of most of its spectators, with the prosecutor saying there was a problem with witness intimidation, witness safety and ""an atmosphere of fear.""Preliminary hearings in juvenile courts are generally open hearings as long as the defendant is 14 years old or older and being charged with a felony. But a juvenile court judge is allowed to close the courtroom ""for good cause shown,"" either on his own or by an attorney's motion.Taybron's attorney, Leslie Siman-Tov, and Nixon's attorney, Gregory Bane, both objected to closing the courtroom, with Siman-Tov saying there ""hasn't been a single bit of evidence"" that anyone had been threatened.But Wilson agreed to close the courtroom based on Bell's assertions, with about 30 spectators having to leave the courtroom. Davis' parents, the defendants' parents, a Daily Press reporter and several others were allowed to stay.Two teenage girls on hand in the group of teens before the shooting began were the prosecution's two witnesses.Neither girl was able to pinpoint what the argument that night was about.But one of the teens testified that she saw the shooting from about 20 feet away, seeing a man with a hoodie opening fire. ""People were yelling at each other,"" she testified. ""I seen somebody reach in their pocket and start shooting.""As she fell behind a potted flower plant, the teen said, she also saw the ""tip of a gun"" being held by someone else. But she couldn't see who was holding it.As for the first shooter, she acknowledged that she had told a police detective after the shooting that she could not ID the shooter because she saw him at an angle and he had a hood on.But in the courtroom on Tuesday, she picked Taybron out in the courtroom as the shooter, though she acknowledged she picked him out of a group of photographs only ""in the past week.""The second prosecution witness testified that she saw Nixon ""go in his pants"" to remove ""something black."" She heard gunfire ""two or three seconds"" later, though she said she had looked away and ""didn't see him shoot nobody.""Both girls' stories were at times unclear and difficult to follow, with the attorneys and judge often having to ask for clarifications.Bane argued that the evidence against Nixon — with no one actually testifying to seeing him open fire — was ""at most"" evidence of brandishing a firearm. Siman-Tov said the evidence against Taybron also fell far short.But Wilson ruled that Bell and the prosecution witnesses had established adequate probable cause.After the hearing, sheriff's deputies escorted Davis' family quickly down an elevator and out of the building to their cars.Nixon's mother, Alfreda McCoy, was visibly upset, saying her son just graduated from Hampton High School and was planning to go to college. ""This has just been a nightmare,"" she said. ""I know he didn't do it, and they know he didn't do it. They are railroading my son."""

317,487261,"By A north side club where four people were shot over the weekend is well known to Milwaukee police.The four people wounded outside Zarko's Nightclub, 4126 N. Teutonia Ave., about 12:45 a.m. Saturday are expected to survive. A motive for the shooting has not been determined and no suspects are in custody, Sgt. Mark Stanmeyer said Monday.According to a review of licensing records for Zarko's Nightclub, police have been summoned to the bar before.On Jan. 12, police were called to the bar on a ""shots fired"" complaint. Police later determined that someone fired a gun near the bar, striking an auto owned by a security guard in the bar's parking lot. No arrests were made.On July 19 of last year, police investigated a complaint of one bar patron striking another.Records indicate that police responded to several complaints in 2011 and 2009. In November 2009, the brother-in-law of owner Michael Tsirlin was killed in an apparent robbery attempt.In April at a meeting of the Common Council's Licenses Committee, Ald.

319,487261,"MILWAUKEE (WIT) -- Four people were shot and wounded outside a north-side nightclub just after 1 a.m. Saturday, according to Milwaukee police.The shooting took place at Zarkos nightclub on the corner of Teutonia and Atkinson. None of the injuries are expected to be life threatening.Police have not said what led to the shooting, or if any suspects are in custody. Neighbors say the club is a trouble spot.""Everyday I go there and pick up bottles, and windows of cars that are the customers of Zarkos, that they try to break into them, and have to sweep that all up and they've done damage to my building, backed into my doors and stuff like that,"" says Gilly Schultz.Schultz owns an auto repair shop right next door and says the club is no stranger to violence, even a murder.""Less than a month ago there was a shooting where they shot from our property at the corner of the building into the Zarkos lot,"" says Schultz.Schultz says the club has changed hands several times over the last four decades. He believes the recent violence may be it's worst.""I think there is a couple of businesses in the neighborhood that would like to see Zarkos closed because of that. I know Astraunatics across the street has had bullet holes through their windows,"" says Schultz.Police say this is an open investigation. They are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call the police department.<strong>Filed in:</strong><strong>Topics:</strong><p>Do you have a story you want FOX6 News to investigate?

320,487261,"Milwaukee police are investigating a quadruple shooting in the 4100 block of N. Teutonia Ave., police said Saturday.The four victims have been hospitalized for non-life threatening injuries, Capt. Donald Gaglione said. The motive for the shooting is under investigation, he said.The incident happened overnight Friday into Saturday. A news release from Milwaukee police did not indicate a specific time of the shooting.A new report says the level of Lake Superior has made a big jump.The International Lake Superior Board of Control reported Friday that the level of Lake Superior jumped 9 inches in May. That's more than twice the normal monthly increase and the second most for any month since 1918.Lake Superior usually rises only about 4 inches each May. But thanks to late snow and a cold spring that held back runoff, May more than made up for the difference.The lake now sits just 7 inches below its long-term average for June 1. It is a full 3 inches above the level at this time last year.<a href=""http://bit.ly/10He2Iw"">The Duluth News Tribune reports</a>West Allis police late Saturday were investigating the death of a 21-month-old child.Police were called to a mobile home in the 10300 block of W. Greenfield Ave. at 4:15 p.m. for an unresponsive child.Attempts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful.Police and the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office are investigating.No other details were provided.A 39-year-old man accused of making a threat to a Greenfield resident was taken into custody Saturday by Oak Creek police.The alleged threat was made about 10 a.m. Police said the man ran into a residence in the 2100 block of W. College Ave. and refused to comply with orders from Oak Creek police officers.After contacting the man on the phone, officers persuaded him to come out of the house.He was taken into custody and will be medically evaluated, police said.The Milwaukee County district attorney's office will review the case to determine if charges are warranted.The Milwaukee County Park System and the Southwest Aquatic Team's Swim America Program are offering free Milwaukee County pool open swim summer passes for the first 200 swimmers who register for lessons at the Wilson Park Pool, near W. Howard Ave. and S. 25th St. in Milwaukee.Those who sign up will also get a free swimming cap and a free pair of goggles.Dale Schrank, the program's director, said he hopes the lessons at Wilson Park Pool will encourage minority youths to learn swimming, as African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately represented in drowning deaths. He said Swim America would like to offer lessons at more locations attracting minorities.Parents who would like to register their children can send checks to SWAT Swim America, P.O. Box 138, Muskego, WI 53150. Alternatively, they can register in person on June 4 or June 6 at the Wilson Park and Recreation Center from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. For more information on the lessons, email swatt@execpc.com or call (262) 971-1658.Wisconsin State Fair-goers may be surprised to learn the main ingredient in a favorite fair treat no longer comes from the dairy state.The Wisconsin Bakers' Association has turned to an Illinois company to provide the cream that makes the fair's cream puffs so popular. Prairie Farms Dairy of Carlinville, Ill., won a contract to supply the cream after The Bakers' Association found no Wisconsin company could handle the daily demand of 1,200 gallons of cream.State Fair spokeswoman Kristi Chuckel Fink equates it to the Packers moving to Illinois. He says ""there's something just not right about it.""A Milwaukee woman faces felony drug charges after her car was stopped for a traffic violation in Racine County, where police say they found marijuana, pills and about $4,500 worth of heroin in her car.The 27-year-old woman — who was a passenger in her vehicle, being driven by someone else — was not identified in a news release from Racine County Sheriff's Office.

324,487266,"After four young people were shot at a birthday party late Saturday night, Metro police will review the operating permits and past code violations of the owner of the social club where the shootings occurred.A large bullet hole shattered the plate-glass window and blood still stains the sidewalk outside of 1913 East 46One youth told Duane White of the Ten Point Coalition that he feared he was about to be attacked by three members of an eastside gang.“A group of guys inside got into it and a chair flew across the room and a fight happened and that’s when security pushed the crowd out,” said White.Once the mostly teenage crowd exited the building, a least five shots were fired.None of the wounds were life threatening as one victim told Fox 59 News he was, “in the wrong place at the wrong time,” and that there were at least three fights inside the party before the shooting.Saturday night’s shootings mark an escalation in youth violence.More than a dozen reports detail brawls and threats by young people downtown in the weekend before the recent Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.IMPD was called to break up a fight at the Marion County Health Department at 4012 North Rural Street Friday night as a graduation party swelled to approximately 400 people.Metro Police Chief Rick Hite is expected to unveil plans this week to combat violent crime in Indianapolis this summer.“We’re in the right places and we’ve identified the right people and we’re getting some of the right results.”Public Safety Director Troy Riggs has been briefed on Hite’s plans for undercover and targeted patrols over the last two months.“I don’t want people to think that we’re waiting on this plan,” said Riggs. “Chief Hite has already instituted changes and you’re already going to see some wins that have already occurred from this plan.”Dozens of wanted persons and felons and a number of guns have been seized in the crackdown which began in the spring.“You’re going to see uniforms and you’re not going to see uniforms,” said Hite, alluding to undercover investigations relying on informants and other evidence. “I think we have a good idea what’s happening in our neighborhoods and in those areas where we know that crime exists. We know we’ll see uniforms…visible uniforms…in those neighborhoods, but in those areas where its covert, you may not necessarily see them, but it’s there.”Riggs said a group of potential offenders and victims will get special attention from IMPD.“We have five thousand individuals coming back to this community every year from prison,” said Riggs. “Five thousand. 1500 of these five thousand have never lived in this city before.”Hite said officers are working closer with the Department of Corrections and the Marion County Probation Department to identify those people.“We’ve identified targets over the year. Some have come back from prison. Some have been lingering for decades. Some families have been operating in this town for a very long time with impunity. We’re just sending a message in a strong way that’s not going to happen much longer.”Police commanders have also encouraged beat officers to emphasize legitimate traffic stops in the search for potential warrant violators and suspected felons.On the city’s northwest district, of approximately 30,000 traffic stops in the last year, one in 11 contacts led to arrests on traffic or other charges, though officers have the option to issue warnings instead.Many of the stops result in arrests for weapons, probation violations or outstanding warrants.<strong>Filed in:</strong>

350,488992,"by NBC 10 NewsAynis Vargas/Courtesy of Vargas familyProvidence Mayor Angel Taveras said Monday the fatal shooting of a 12-year-old girl ""shakes your core"" and that it shouldn't happen anywhere.Aynis Vargas was shot and killed Saturday night while attending a graduation party at a house on 256 Hartford Ave.Police said three other women, 44-year-old Vilma Tineo, 23-year-old Elaine Devargas, and 33-year-old Eugelyn Cabera-Martinez were also shot. Police said Tineo was treated and released from the hospital, Devargas remains in good condition and Cabera-Martinez is in fair condition.Juliana Conteh had just entered her apartment nearby when the shooting happened.""I was very scared, terrified. I couldn't even sleep because the moment I opened the door, it happened and I think it could have been me, because the person next to me got shot too,"" she said.The shooting has sent shock waves throughout the city.""There's simply no way you can explain it and it's not something that should happen anywhere in our city, in our state, country or in the world. Twelve-year-old girls should not lose their life to violence,"" Taveras said.Providence police were seen Monday afternoon canvassing the area.""This shooter, he is a coward,"" said Chief of the Providence Police Department Col. Hugh Clements.""This investigation is certainly moving forward and we're happy with where it is today. Some of these investigations take longer than others. In the end, we will flush out this shooter.""Clements wouldn't comment about suspects or a motive, but witnesses told NBC 10 the shooter opened fire on the gathering without notice and then fled the area.Vargas's uncle told The Providence Journal on Monday the shooter was wearing a black mask and camouflage, and the 12-year-old was shot in the back.""This is a tragedy. We have to realize that we all have a role to play to make our community safer, to educate our children and to hold people that commit acts like this accountable and to put them away so they will never be in a position to hurt someone again,"" Clements said.A makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and stuffed animals mark the area where Vargas was killed.The girl's father told NBC 10 that he's looking for justice and wants whoever was responsible caught.He said his daughter was an energetic child who like acting and singing and would have started middle school in the fall.Vargas' death was the eighth homicide in Providence this year.<em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em>"
351,488992,"PROVIDENCE — He didn’t fire the gun, but a young man who was with a fellow gang member who murdered a 12-year-old girl and injured three women was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years for being involved.<p xmlns="""">PROVIDENCE — He didn’t fire the gun, but a young man who was with a fellow gang member who murdered a 12-year-old girl and injured three women was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years for being involved.</p>PROVIDENCE — He didn’t fire the gun, but a young man who was with a fellow gang member who murdered a 12-year-old girl and injured three women was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years for being involved.Angel “Young Cyph” Valerio, now 20, was in a minivan with four other Harriet Street gang members the night of June 15, 2013, when they drove to the Hartford Park housing complex seeking retaliation over a broken van window and the murder of a friend.Valerio, who sat in the back row of the van, thought they were just going to fight their rivals, said his court-appointed lawyer William C. Dimitri. He didn’t believe that Valerio knew that one of his friends had a gun.The Hartford Soldiers weren’t out that night, just women and children at a high school graduation party. Yet, one of the gang members took the gun to the party and opened fire, killing 12-year-old Aynis Vargas and wounded Vilma Tineo, Elaine Devargas, and Eugelyn Cabrera-Martinez.Facing sentencing before Superior Court Judge Robert D. Krause, Valerio read a letter of apology to Aynis’ family and the three women. When he’d gotten together with his friends that night, Valerio thought they were just going to hang out and smoke marijuana, he said in his statement to the court. The shooting was not part of the night’s plan, he said.Valerio called the shooting “inexcusable,” and wrote that he was sorry for what happened and “deeply sorry” for the death of Aynis. “Her life was just beginning,” Valerio wrote in his letter.Dimitri said later that Aynis’ family and the victims were there to hear Valerio’s apology. None of Valerio’s family or friends were there to see him.Valerio has had little support in his young life, Dimitri said. Valerio’s father left when he was six. His mother left when he was 13. He has seven half-siblings, but none were part of his life, Dimitri said.Friends let Valerio stay at their homes, giving him a place to sleep, and he was also sent to group homes, Dimitri said. He eventually graduated from Central High School.But Valerio has been mainly on his own, Dimitri said. “He became a product of his environment,” Dimitri said later. “Abandoned by his parents and turned to the streets.”The gang became Valerio’s family — and the state prosecutor attacked the gang life as a destructive force.Assistant Attorney General James Baum urged the judge to issue a sentence that punished Valerio and deterred others from gang violence and retaliation, “to further send a message that this is not a drama.“It is not about posing and throwing hand-signs or playing a vacuous game of respect reported in, and fueled by, social media or competing videos,” Baum said, in a statement from the attorney general’s office. “It’s a blood sport that ends lives – the lives of those foolish enough to play along and the lives of those innocent enough just to live in a neighborhood or celebrate at a party on a warm summer night.”All five of the young gang members out that night have been convicted for their roles in the shooting.The gunman, 22-year-old Branden Castro, pleaded guilty in April to charges of murder, assault and conspiracy and is serving consecutive life sentences, plus 50 years. Ricardo Vasquez, 21, who drove the minivan to Hartford Park, pleaded guilty in September 2013 and is serving a life sentence. Luis “Didi” Gonzalez, 19, has pleaded guilty to assault and conspiracy charges, while his 24-year-old brother Luis “Fat Boy” Gonzalez – who told Castro to “bang the party” — was found guilty by a jury in June of several assault and gun charges. Both are awaiting sentencing.Under the terms of the plea agreement, which the attorney general’s office said was reached with victims’ approval, Valerio pleaded guilty to three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon.Judge Krause sentenced Valerio to 15 years, with 12 years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions. One year for every year of Aynis’ life.Her father, Teomel Vargas, gave a statement about losing “an innocent, sweet and happy child.” Justice was now being served, he said.“When a person takes a life away by accident, that person has to pay, but if it was done intentionally, the price to pay is higher,” Vargas said in his statement.“Sometimes people are given an opportunity to change, but in the majority of the time they are not in the disposition to change for better,” Vargas added, “and they continue to drag malice in their mind and heart.”

357,487891,"(Simon Gutierrez) Investigators with the Houston Police Department say the shooting happened Manny's Place -- an after-hours club in a strip center in the 9700 block of Bissonnet near Country Creek. It's the type of venue officers say they are all too familiar with.  There's no sign on the door or marquee, but just before 6am Saturday, this late-night and early-morning venue erupted in violence.	 	 Four people were injured in a shooting. Two men and two women were taken to nearby hospitals.  One of the men later died. His name has not been released.  Two of the injured victims were working as security guards at the club, police tell us.  ""The shooting started outside of the club and the shots were fired in the direction of the club,"" HPD Homicide Detective Jesus Sosa said. ""From what we've gathered so far, we have one shooter.""  Police said an altercation began when the two security guards who were shot refused to let a man enter the club. As they were dealing with that man, someone from the other side of the parking lot started firing a gun toward the club's entrance, officials said.  The shooter fled the scene, but it's unknown in which direction. Police also are not sure if the shooter left the scene on foot or in a vehicle.  It's the second   ""Some of them say that they aren't serving alcohol, but we typically find that they do serve alcohol. And if they are serving alcohol, it leads to disturbances,"" Sosa said.  At least one business owner in the same strip center says he's filed a complaint with HPD about the illegal activities going on here, saying it's hard for him to run a business with those types of things going on   ""They need to close it down today,"" he said. ""There doesn't need to be an after-hour across the street from my job site.""  And customers we spoke to in the strip center Saturday felt the same way.   ""It sounds like trouble,"" Pam Steadham said. ""Why can't you do what you need to do, 2 o'clock comes, go home?""  HPD Homicide detectives are investigating this case. They detained one man at the scene, but we're told he was a witness and is not a suspect.  	 The shooter remains on the loose, and witnesses at the scene are saying they didn't see anything.  ""It's hard to establish the identity of the suspect if no one is willing to cooperate,"" Sosa said.  Anyone with any information on what happened or details that could help police identify the shooter is urged to call HPD or Crime Stoppers.  Crime Stoppers will pay up to $5,000 for any information called in to the 713-222-TIPS (8477) or submitted online at   "

369,488547,"(AP) GREENVILLE, N.C. - A man who investigators think shot four people near a Greenville Wal-Mart appears to have planned the shooting but picked out his victims at random, Greenville Police Chief Hassan Aden said Sunday.Aden identified the suspect as Lakim Anthony Faust and said the 23-year-old Greenville man will be charged with four counts of attempted first-degree murder when he recovers from gunshot wounds he suffered as police took him into custody Friday.Investigators haven't found any links between Faust and the four victims, Aden said at a news conference. But evidence gathered during a search of Faust's home appears to show he had some plan for the attack and wanted to shoot a number of people, the chief said.""Some of the way, the manner with which he carried it out, sort of indicates that he had some idea to what he wanted to do. But we don't know that for certain,"" Aden said.Police said Faust used a pistol-gripped shotgun to shoot a man in a car outside a law firm, crossed five lanes of traffic and shot three more people outside a Wal-Mart in the city of about 87,000 people around 85 miles east of Raleigh.More than 100 rounds of shotgun ammunition were found on Faust after police shot him, Aden said.A phone listing for Faust couldn't be found, and it wasn't immediately clear whether he has a lawyer.Faust is recovering from wounds to his arms and legs. Aden would not say when he might be released from the hospital.Faust had a short criminal record that included property crimes but no signs of violence, Aden said.The police chief visited the four people wounded before Sunday's news conference. He said some had serious injuries, but they all are recovering. He did not release their names or conditions.Authorities serving a search warrant on Faust's home first sent in a robot to check for any other victims or possible traps inside, but Aden said they didn't find any.Police did find documents and computers that are helping investigators figure out why Faust started shooting, Aden said. The computer has been sent to FBI headquarters to be analyzed further, he said.""It is a very complex investigation. We still are talking to a lot of people and looking at his background,"" Aden said.Investigators have no evidence anyone helped Faust in the shootings, but they also haven't ruled that out, the police chief said.The officers who shot Faust have been put on administrative leave while the State Bureau of Investigation investigates the shooting.<a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="""" href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/1770-5_162-0.html?query=north+carolina+shooting&amp;tag=srch&amp;section=504083&amp;searchtype=cbsSearch"">Complete coverage of the North Carolina shooting on Crimesider</a>

372,488833,"A woman was killed and three other women and a man injured in an early-morning shooting that left bullet holes and blood spots across an East Baltimore street, police said.Police responded to a reported shooting in the 700 block of N. Kenwood Ave. in the city's Madison-Eastend neighborhood about 1:27 a.m. Saturday and found the five victims, each suffering from at least one gunshot wound, police said.Donyae Jones, 18, who was shot in the chest, was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead at 2:12 a.m., police said. She lived on the block where she was shot. The four other victims were taken to area hospitals with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said.Another man was non-fatally injured after police were called to a shooting in the 200 Block of Mason Court around 4:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon.The shootings marked a violent start to the summer, which also saw a man shot in West Baltimore on Friday and a man killed in Northwest Baltimore on Saturday morning.Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said that a lot of people were outside on Kenwood Avenue on Friday night and that detectives are interviewing a number of people who saw the shooting. Police are trying to work out a motive, he added, and think it might have been a dispute that had escalated.Members of the homicide unit were also surveying the scene Saturday morning and speaking to the few people sitting out on their steps.One woman, who declined to give her name, said she was inside when the shooting started. She described two bursts of gunfire with a pause between.""When I hear shots, I don't move,"" she said. ""Bullets got no conscience, they'll go anywhere.""Neighbors, who were just starting to come out into the street around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, were greeted by signs of the early-morning violence.Trails of blood were visible on both sides of the street. Red splatters marked the front steps up to one house. Further down the street, a trail of drips wound its way off the sidewalk and across the road, ending at a dropped soda cup and box of take-out food.As the morning wore on, homicide detectives left and were replaced by uniformed officers, who took up posts on the west side of the street. Guglielmi said Commissioner Anthony W. Batts has ordered additional uniformed and plainclothes officers to be deployed to the neighborhood.Last Memorial Day, four people were shot in a single incident, including a 10-year-old boy, but shootings with so many victims are unusual. Guglielmi called Saturday's outburst and those like it ""anomalies.""Citywide shootings and homicides remain at about the same level as last year, with 100 people killed as of June 15 and 163 shot, according to police statistics. But in the Eastern District, shootings and killings are both down significantly, according to department data.Police on Saturday also reported a Friday afternoon shooting in the 1600 block of Smallwood St., in the Easterwood Neighborhood in West Baltimore.Officers were dispatched to Johns Hopkins Hospital about 6:51 p.m. after a man had walked in with a gunshot wound. The man, who had been shot in the hand, told police he had been sitting in his car on Smallwood Street when two men approached and started firing.A man died in the Arlington neighborhood after suffering multiple gunshot wounds, police said. Officers went to the 5200 block of Cuthbert Ave. at 11:30 a.m. Saturday and found the victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.<em><a href=""mailto:iduncan@baltsun.com"">iduncan@baltsun.com</a></em><em>twitter.com/iduncan</em><em>Jessica Anderson contributed to this report.<br/></em>"

375,488833,"“Our messaging this weekend was terrible,” said Police Chief Batts, as Mayor Rawlings-Blake decries the flow of illegal guns.<span data-reactid="".2cihryff8jk.0.3.0.1.1.4.0"">Above: </span>Anthony Batts, nine months into his job as Baltimore’s police chief, insisted today that he was prepared for the outbreak of violence that left 28 people shot and 10 people killed in the city since Friday.In a joint appearance with Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who returned to City Hall this morning after a six-day absence to attend a meeting of mayors in Las Vegas, Batts defended his leadership role.“I am connected to this organization. I am driving directions almost every single hour,” he told reporters at his first formal briefing since the crime wave began.When the shooting spree started on Friday night, he said his chief field commander was giving him constant updates, “and I was giving him directions every single hour this weekend, so I was aware” of the violence.“All weekend,” he continued, “we knew what was taking place. We were trying to get in front of it very quickly.”Where he faulted the department – and himself – was on public relations.“Our messaging this weekend was terrible. We should have been in front of you, telling exactly what was going on.”Today he revealed that he had reassigned the department’s chief spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, to a community partnership office following Guglielmi comment on Monday that “all in all, Rawlings-Blake said reducing violent crime was the No. 1 priority of her administration. (Photo by Mark Reutter)<strong>Illegal Guns a Topic in Las Vegas</strong>Mayor Rawlings-Blake seized upon the issue of illegal guns when discussing the crime spree, noting that this matter was vigorously addressed at a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting she “I want to again emphasize the importance of stopping the flow of illegal guns into America’s cities,” she said today in prepared remarks. “We only have one gun store in the city of Baltimore, so it’s clear that not enough is being done to disrupt the pipeline of illegal guns into Baltimore and other cities. In the past few days I met with my fellow mayors from across the county and this issue was front and center to all of us.”Addressing the murders that took place during her absence, the mayor said, “I have to share with you really how angry I am and concerned about what happened over the weekend – two dozen shootings, several of them fatal. And I say angry but it’s such a mix of emotions. It’s angry, it’s frustrated, it’s extreme sadness, particularly when we look at the fact that it is not outside invaders killing members of our community, it’s us killing us.”She continued in her prepared remarks, “It was a terrible display of ugly and senseless violence. We know that those who perpetrate those acts [have] power to disgrace our communities and city. We got to do everything to apprehend them and bring them to justice.“Reducing violence,” she added, “is the No. 1 priority of my administration. I will not be satisfied until Baltimore becomes one of the safest big cities in the country.”<strong>“You Don’t Understand My Outrage”<br/>
</strong>Stepping to the dais after the mayor, Chief Batts said that news reports often refer to the number of murder victims. “These are not numbers. These are human beings.”Referring to Donyae Jones, an African-American woman who was killed early Saturday morning on the 700 block of North Kenwood Avenue, Batts said, “I look at this little 18-year-old girl who was lost this weekend on Kenwood. I look as I go out on the streets at the McCulloh Homes yesterday, where some kids were out, but some gang members fired shots out there, putting at risk those young kids. And I talked to mothers who were out there. Outrage? You don’t understand my outrage about those circumstances. I’ve made it very clear to my staff, I made it very clear to our organization, that we will respond, certainly.”Batts said the Kenwood Avenue shootings, which left four people shot in addition to Jones, were related to gang rivalries. He said three gangs, the Bloods, Black Guerrilla Family and DJ Boys, “a new crew,” were fighting for territory.Deputy Police Commissioner John Skinner said that “a tremendous amount of information” has been coming from the community in the wake of the shootings. A “wave of arrests,” he said, is about to be made of suspects.<strong>“Yes, We Were Ready”</strong>Asked if he felt he was prepared for the surge in violence that typically strikes Baltimore in the summer, Batts said:“From day one from when I walked in, we were preparing for this summer. And getting ready. Deputy Commissioner Skinner, one of the things I have him doing with his staff is every three months I want a plan on what we’re doing, our attack plan, our methods and our strategy. Not only tactically but strategically at the same time. We were prepared for the summer. We put things in place. We had a strategy that was out there.”He continued, “This was a very dramatic weekend. We were responding behind the scenes. We were ready for it. Yes, we had things in place.”But he cautioned that even the best planning cannot prevent all crime. “The random stuff that takes place because you step on my toes or because you look at me wrong – that was some of the things that were taking place this weekend also.”"

They were the latest victims in a series of shootings in the city.<p xmlns="""">PROVIDENCE - Four persons were shot outside a birthday party Saturday night on Curtis Street, the police said. They were the latest victims in a series of shootings in the city.</p>PROVIDENCE - Four persons were shot outside a birthday party Saturday night on Curtis Street, the police said. They were the latest victims in a series of shootings in the city.The police said they arrived at about 9:30 to find victims in the driveway and the back yard at 55 Curtis, a trail of blood up the driveway, shell casings and one live round on the sidewalk and an unhelpful crowd of 30 to 40 persons.Of the persons shot, two were minors. One of them was shot in the left temple and the other in the left ankle.The others victims were Sombun Chet, 39, of 278 Manton Ave., Providence, who was shot in the back, and Oeun Sak, 26, shot in the  left arm. All were taken to Rhode Island Hospital for treatment, in four ambulances, three from Providence and the other from North Providence.The police also found a white van parked in the street front of the 58 Curtis St.  Two of the right side windows were broken and there was an apparent bullet hole in the same side. It appeared as though a suspect or suspects had taken cover behind the van while firing.Police from several units canvassed the crowd but said they found people ""generally uncooperative"" and unable to supply specific information about the shootings.   Witnesses told police that all four victims had been in front of  55 Curtis. One of them said that he noticed an occupied  Nissan Maxima on Bosworth Street near the place where the shots may have been fired from.The trail of blood at 55 Curtis led up the driveway into the rear yard. The police said that it wasn't clear where the blood came from.The police also found several bullet holes in the left side of the house next door, the side facing 55 Curtis.On Friday, meanwhile, a 16-year-old city youth was shot through the leg on Violet Street, police said.  Responding to a report of shots fired at at Violet and Chalkstone Ave. they learned that someone had driven the victim to the hospital.  He told the police that he was shot after a fight with a man he did not know, near the 7-Eleven on Smith Street. The police said the victim was uncooperative.The city's ninth homicide victim, Jose Sanchez, whose last known address was 108 Berkshire St., was found near Clym and June streets after the police responded to reports of shots fired early Saturday.That followed the killing of 12-year-old Aynis Vargas, at the Hartford Park public housing project on the night of June 15. Three women were injured in the shooting.

													Two Eastside event halls known for fights, shootouts and killings might pose fewer problems if they were under city regulations, some local leaders say.Emotion Event Hall on Dodds Avenue and an unnamed building at 2510 E. Main St. aren't required under present law to get a beer permit for functions they host, said Chattanooga Police Chief Bobby Dodd.Traditionally, the board provides a check on businesses that serve alcohol, revoking licenses when there is trouble and often putting the offender out of business.However, after several shootings left three dead and many injured outside the halls, officials are exploring whether local codes should be changed.""We realize this is an issue and we are currently looking into what options are available to us,"" said Lacie Stone, Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke's spokeswoman.Gary Ball, former president of the Ridgedale Community Association, said neighbors have been vocal about the need for more regulations on the venues.""I think we go back to the alcohol code and try to bring it up to 2013. There has to be some kind of responsibility on people who want to run these event halls,"" Ball said. ""It's just like having a saloon in Dodge City in 1872. It's an archaic law the police acknowledge they can't operate under.""•••Disorders involving weapons, shootings and loud music are among the types of complaints that send Chattanooga police officers to the venues that are just blocks apart.Emotion Event Hall at 1622 Dodds Ave., also called Da Building, is near a day care center and a church.Records show 63 police responses since 2010, including 10 for fights or disorders, four for shots fired, 15 for a burglary alarm and 13 for loud music.On July 5, a shooting left 21-year-old Ladarius Daniel dead and another man wounded. A juvenile was shot and killed several years ago.The East Main Street venue has been known as The Wet Bar, The G Spot and Boo Coe's Sports Bar and Grill, county records show. Police have been called there 43 times since 2010, including eight times for disorders or fights and once for a 2010 shooting in which at least four people were wounded.On June 23, 19-year-old Demetrius Davis was killed and three men -- including two 126 Athens Park Blood gang members -- were wounded near the hall.On June 11, a 31-year-old man was shot and wounded.On April 2, 28-year-old Desmond McClure was killed in a shooting outside the hall.Even with the recent events, Dodd said it takes a pattern of calls and an investigation to prove that a business is a nuisance and should be shuttered.""It's still not enough to get it shut down,"" he said.In the vast majority of cases, officers rush to answer calls for fights or shots fired but arrive to find no one there, he said. The calls get relabeled as miscellaneous. They don't hold up in court.""There's not a whole lot the officer can do if they can't prove there was an assault,"" Dodd said.The fire marshal and code enforcement inspectors also examine bars looking for violations.A city email stated there was no reason to close down the venue at 2510 E. Main St.""There were no major violations found from our codes enforcement side. It does appear that minor issues are being corrected. ... Their findings along with the Fire Marshal found no justification for an E-Team inspection of the facility at this time,"" the email from the Department of Neighborhood Services and Community Development stated.•••The city's alcohol laws were adopted in the late 1970s and early 1980s.One provision states that anyone who purchases a case of beer -- 24 beers -- from a retailer for a venue must submit his name and address to the police chief by noon the following business day. Anyone who buys more than three cases of beer must get a permit from the chief.""I've never had anyone send me one of these,"" Dodd said.Dexter Staples, who owns Da Building, said in a previous interview that no more than three cases are allowed at his business. He said there was security and the venue was closed when the latest shooting happened.Ball is skeptical about the amount of beer in the event halls.""Nobody counts how many beer cans are there at 2 a.m."" he said.Dodd believes problems arise because the venues sometimes are used as after-hours clubs.""The problems start usually when people leave other locations at 3 a.m. They have already been drinking or using drugs. They all go to a central location that's open till five or six o'clock in the morning. And you've got people from different parts of town, people from different gang associations,"" Dodd said.""My suggestion is going to be anybody who is in the entertainment business, whether it's an event hall, a music hall, a club, bar or whatever, they close down at 3 o'clock.""Ken Crisp, who owns Lindsay Street Hall just off of M.L. King Boulevard, said he has no problem with a 3 a.m. closing.Crisp, who has a beer permit for his business but does not sell beer, said guests bring their own alcohol for his staff to serve.""We typically have a high-end client who spends $15,000 to $75,000 for a wedding. ... For the most part, our typical party ends around 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. at the latest. We are lucky in that regard,"" he said.In the meantime, Ball hopes local laws can be restructured so event halls have to have permits.""It's time for everybody who has a vested interest in this to sit down,"" Ball said. ""We're just talking about something that has checks and balances.""Contact staff writer Beth Burger at bburger@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6406. Follow her on Twitter at twitter.com/abburger."

I really couldn't say if that was the reason.""He said the gun sounded like a semiautomatic and he doesn't know who the shooter was or the motive.""The shots were coming back to back,"" he said. ""It just happened so fast. He shot a lot of times though.""McCane said he was on the way to a nearby club when the shooting happened. The four were shot near a laundromat at 1501 Dodds Ave.Davis posted on his Facebook page that he recently was hired for a job.""[T]hem long nights an my granny prayers paid off, time to leave ... da streets. #blessed,"" he posted.Davis had 2,380 friends.Friends and family members continued to post messages mourning his loss.""I lost my son last night, my heart is so heavy right now!! Tears can't stop rolling down my face!!"" said Mona Davis, Davis' mother, who lives in Atlanta.As of Monday afternoon, no arrest had been made in the shooting.This year, the city has had 65 shooting incidents that resulted in death or injury with 75 victims, according to data collected by the Chattanooga Times Free Press.There have been 14 homicides.

Others concerned the storage of a gas can inside the building, lack of an inspection tag on a fire extinguisher and non-working smoke detectors.The fire marshal shut off electricity to the building until the owner corrects the problems using a licensed electrician, according to the inspection report. The fire marshal also notified the building’s owner that the maximum occupancy is 49.The owner, who refused to provide his name to The Star when reached by phone, said the violations were small, such as not having outlets covered, and nearly all the violations had been fixed. He said he began renting the building to the Redline Riders motorcycle club about a year ago after the club approached him and said it was a nonprofit group working toward nonviolence.Because of the recent problems, the owner said, he probably will seek a beautician or barber for his next tenant.Police accompanied the inspectors Tuesday and cited the motorcycle club with running a nuisance business, said Sgt. Brad Dumit, who supervises the vice unit. He said the ordinance violation included allegations of blocking the street and sidewalk and playing loud music late at night.
The club drew the attention of police and city and county officials after the 3:30 a.m. melee Sunday that started inside the club. When officers arrived, they saw 250 to 300 people fleeing.Police say many of the people were not inside the club but were nearby along Prospect Avenue. Club patrons told police they paid a cover charge and gave donations to buy beer.A disturbance between two or more people inside the club led to a gunman opening fire in the cramped quarters, said Sgt. Joe Mabin. The dispute spread outside, where more than one gunman continued to fire, Mabin said. The bullets killed Marlon E. Randolph, 23, and critically wounded a teenage girl, who was shot in the head.Detectives still don’t know exactly what kicked off the dispute. They continue to look for witnesses.Anyone with information should call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-TIPS (8477).Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand."

There were shots fired both inside and outside the club.

No backup with assault rifle and started pointing the gun at everyone,"" Maddux recalled.When Maddux felt safe, he recorded a video of the officer using his phone.  Maddux said the officer's brave action scattered 300 people in under two minutes without firing a shot.""Jumping out in front of 300 people with guns takes a lot of guts,"" he said.Some witnesses to the shooting waited throughout the morning for police to interview them and release their vehicles from the crime scene.Mr. Swag, the owner of the club, who is also part of the biker group known as the Red Line Riders, told FOX 4 News his biker group has been out in the community doing good and this latest incident is not something they stand for.""It hurts to see someone in the city pass away, but it hurts even worse when you are around it when the incident happens.

403,489987,"A woman was killed and four other people were wounded early this morning in a drive-by shooting in the Park Manor neighborhood on the South Side.Around 2:30 a.m., a car carrying five people was near the intersection of 73rd Street and King Drive when another car pulled alongside, said Police News Affairs Officer John Mirabelli, citing preliminary information.A person inside the second car opened fire, striking the five in the other car,  Mirabelli said.Marissa Boyd-Stangley, 19, of the 7400 block of South Eberhart Avenue, suffered wounds to her head and body and was pronounced dead at 6:05 a.m. at the morgue, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.A 20-year-old man suffered wounds to his chest and was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in serious-to-critical condition.Another 20-year-old man suffered a wound to his shoulder and was taken to Saint Bernard Hospital and Health Care Center, where his condition was stabilized, Mirabelli said.An 18-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were both shot in the hand and were taken to A neighbor said he was awaken by the shots, then heard someone at his door.“A woman was shot in the hand,”  he said. “She walked up to our door and asked us for help.” The neighbor said the woman was calm, but one of the men who was wounded was jumping up and down and yelling about a gang. The woman who died was lying on the ground outside of the car, he said. “Whoever the shooter or shooters were, they caught (the victims) by surprise,” the neighbor said. “It appeared as if they followed the victims and caught them at a stop light. “I don’t know if it's related but there were large groups, a lot of people, hanging out on both sides of  74th Street and Vernon yesterday.” He said police removed bullets from the driver’s side door, trunk and back windows of the car.No description of the gunman or the car was available.<em><strong><a href=""mailto:dawilliams@tribune.com"">dawilliams@tribune.com </a></strong></em>"
404,489987,"Two weeks have passed since a neighbor knocked on Nortasha Stingley’s door with the grim news: Her 19-year-old daughter Marissa had been gunned down just blocks from their Park Manor home.“I asked her, 'Where’s Marissa at, where’s my baby?' ” Stingley said, fighting back tears. “She said, 'Marissa got shot,' and pointed to her eye.” Stingley said she talked to detectives later that day and hasn't heard from them since. Now about two weeks later, she fears her daughter has been forgotten.“I have done everything in my power to keep my kids safe,” said Stingley, a single mother who also has two sons, 6 and 18. “This is the one time I couldn’t. I just want to know why. What happened to my baby?”Police reported no arrests as of Wednesday and could provide no description of the shooter, except that he fled in a black SUV after opening fire at another car about 2:30 a.m. on June 25 at a stoplight at 73rd Street and King Drive.Marissa Boyd-Stingley was one of five passengers inside that other car. She was shot in the head, and another woman, a neighbor, was wounded in the hand. Three men, one age 18 and two age 20, were also shot: One in the chest, one in the shoulder, and the other in the hand, police said. Boyd-Stingley was the only one who died.Nortasha Stingley said she had felt something wasn't right that night and had called her daughter early that morning, worried.“I woke up and sat straight up in my bed and called her,” she said. It was shortly before 1 a.m. “I asked her where she was and told her I loved her and to be careful. God woke me up to tell my baby I love her one last time and I thank him for that.” About two hours later, Stingley heard banging on her first-floor window and rushed to the door, thinking it was her daughter. But it was her neighbor saying her daughter had been shot.The next moments are a blur to Stingley. She remembers cursing and crying and finally screaming for the neighbor to leave her house. She could only think of what more she could have done to save her daughter. Earlier this year, her daughter had come home from While Stingley underwent medical tests, her daughter cared for her 6-year-old brother Levell.  Still, Stingley said she did not feel at ease with her daughter’s decision to come home. “My chest was heavy and I didn’t know why,” she said. “I didn’t like the company she was keeping. Something just didn’t feel right.” She worried about a young man Marissa had met -- a man who was in the car when the shots were fired. Neighbors had warned Stingley about the man, telling her he was “no good,” she said.  The man and her daughter, along with other friends, had been at the lake on the day of the shooting and were on their way home.None of the people who were with her daughter that night has contacted her to share information about what led up to the shooting, Stingley said. “I want the people in the car to sit down with me and the police. I want to know what happened that night,” Stingley said. “Why isn’t the mayor, the governor, the first lady coming to my house for my baby? She was good, she wasn’t a criminal. She was a student. Why doesn’t anyone care?“I laid a foundation of morals, respect and decency for my kids,” Stingley said as she sat in her living room next to her daughter’s high school diploma. “My daughter’s only mistake was going out that night with possibly the wrong people. Did she deserve to die because of that mistake?  “This hole in my heart is where my daughter used to be. I have to be strong, but things will never be the same.""Stingley busies herself with her two other children, Levell and Thomas, 18. Levell, at 6, doesn’t quite understand that his big sister is gone.  “Marissa ran away,” he said. “I miss her. ... Please find Marissa.”Thomas just visited “Marissa was a well-rounded person,” he said Wednesday as he was leaving his job. “She cared about others more than herself.” Thomas said he would like to know why there is so much ammunition and weapons in the street. “I think they should open a draft and send these people to the military since they like to handle weapons,” Thomas said. <em><strong><a href=""mailto:dawilliams@tribune.com"" target=""_blank"">dawilliams@tribune.com</a></strong></em><em><strong>Twitter: @neacynewslady</strong></em>"

Wells is currently being held on a $2 million bond after turning himself in to police.Wells spoke with NBC 5 from jail on Tuesday. He cried when asked about what happened Monday. He was apologetic but said he did not want to talk about it.""No one deserved what happened,"" Wells said of the deaths of his girlfriend, her brother and her mother. ""It shouldn't happen. It should never even have happened."" ""I just want, even if the family don't want it, I just want to tell them that I'm praying for them,"" he said.Family members of the victims said Wells is Chanice Reed's boyfriend of Chanice Reed and the father of her unborn child.They said they are struggling to understand how someone they've known for so long is now accused of killing four of their family members.""How could you? How could you take away innocent lives like that?"" said Monique Myers, Chanice Reed's cousin.Myers said she had just talked with her cousin on Monday about Wells, her on-again, off-again boyfriend.""She told me he was controlling. He didn't like her being with her own family. I talked to her and said, 'Chanice, leave him,'"" said Myers, who added that she never thought the couple's problems would end with a deadly shooting.""You love a person, you're not supposed to hurt them. That's not the way, just not the way,"" Shauna Myers-Berry said.The victim's family told NBC 5 that Wells shot Ann Reed in the yard before confronting and shooting Chanice Reed at the front door. Afterward, he killed Ann Reed's youngest child, Eddie McCuin, family members said.""He just shot her point blank, because she was in the door, went into the room and shot my cousin, Eddie, three times,"" Myers said. ""You're going to have a child yourself. For you to kill the mom, mother of your child, her brother -- you don't have a heart. It's going to be a cold day in hell.""Tension flared Monday night when Myers and several other family members crossed the police barricade and ran to the family's home.""At that time, we didn't know anything,"" Myers-Berry said. ""We just took off running.""Her son and other daughter were arrested on suspicion of assault and interfering with officers guarding the crime scene after a scuffle with officers.""The only thing we were thinking [was], 'Don't stop us. Tell us what's going on,"" Myers said.Police reports show that Jermey Myers, 20, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer. Kalie Myers, 18, was arrested on suspicion of interfering with police duties for impeding officers trying to guard the crime scene.<em>NBC 5's Ben Russell and Kendra Lyn contributed to this report.</em><strong>More Dallas-Fort Worth-Area Stories:</strong><ul><li><a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Slain-Sheriffs-Deputy-Laid-to-Rest-213964821.html?_osource=nbcnewsmore"" target=""_blank"">Slain Sheriff's Deputy to be Laid to Rest</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Neighbors-Discover-Childs-Dead-Body-Underneath-Tarp-on-Saginaw-Street-213959331.html?_osource=nbcnewsmore"" target=""_blank"">Child's Body Discovered Underneath Tarp</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Contagious-Virus-Spreads-Among-Kids-213926291.html?_osource=nbcnewsmore"" target=""_blank"">Contagious Virus Spreads Among Kids</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Man-Surrenders-After-Hours-on-High-5-Ledge-213915821.html?_osource=nbcnewsmore"" target=""_blank"">Man Surrenders After Hours on High 5 Ledge</a></li></ul>  "

The party store is located at North Perry Street and Chamberlain Street.A gunman opened fire at a crowd of several hundred spectators at an informal July 4th fireworks show hosted by a local party store, killing a 33-year-old father and injuring his two children and four other people.Several hundred people had gathered in front of Perry's Palace Liquor Store at North Perry and Chamberlain streets about 11 p.m. Thursday. After a fight broke out at the store, a suspect fired shots into the crowd, according to the Oakland County Sheriff's Office.Deputies and Oakland County Medical Examiner's Office investigators confirm that a 33-year-old Pontiac man was killed after sustaining a gunshot wound to the head.A 35-year-old Pontiac man was arrested at about 4 a.m. Friday, deputies said. He was taken into custody at his home after several witnesses on the scene identified him. Detectives continue to seek warrants and investigate.The victim's 6- and 12-year-old children also were injured in the shooting. His 6-year-old son was shot in the head, officials report. The boy suffered injuries that were not life threatening and was transported to Children's Hospital in Detroit, where he remains in stable condition.The man's 12-year-old daughter suffered an injury to her forearm. She was treated at McLaren Oakland Hospital and released.Two 22-year-old women also were shot in their lower legs. A 28-year-old man was shot once in the hip and forearm, and a 23-year-old man was shot once in the leg.'No value of life'The motive for the late-night shootings is unclear.According to the sheriff's office, fireworks were ""being discharged by Perry Palace Party Store personnel.""A sign that hangs above the entrance of the store advertises for a company called Big Fireworks, which has warehouses in Michigan and South Carolina, according to its website. The sign reads ""Go big or go home,"" next to ""FIREWORKS,"" printed in block lettering.An employee at Perry's Palace Friday declined to comment, saying only, ""It all happened outside.""Fino's Family Dining, which faces the party store from across Perry Street, was not open while fireworks -- which were not official City of Pontiac displays -- were being lit.On Friday, waitress Ashley Owens, 23, who lives nearby, said she saw people scattering in the area.Sue Calhoun, manager of neighboring B & E's Bar, said there's usually a crowd around this time of year near the intersection.""They light off fireworks every year,"" said Calhoun, 51, whose bar was open around the time of the shootings. However, ""I heard they didn't do them this year.""Calhoun also heard that the scuffle might have escalated when the suspect was hit with a door and bumped on the way out of the party store. She shared her thoughts: ""There's no value of life anymore.""Sheriff Michael Bouchard said Friday that Thursday's random violence is disturbing and completely unacceptable.""Great police work, once again, resulted in a suspect quickly being identified and removed from the street, but it will never fill the hole his senseless violence created,"" Bouchard said via email. ""However, we will hold him and anyone else that commits a violent act accountable.  If you hurt others, we are coming for you.""Staff writer John Turk covers the Oakland County Board of Commissioners, police and general assignment.

And when gunfire erupted on Saturday evening, there were few residents who did not recognize the sound, or shake their heads at its deadly result:An 18-year-old man dead on the scalding summer pavement; a 13-year-old boy critically wounded by a bullet to the neck; and two other boys, 14 and 15, each hit in the leg by bullets.“The only thing that changes is the faces,” Chuck Xavier, 47, a lifelong resident of the Marcy Houses, said. “It’s sad.”By Sunday, detectives had narrowed in on a possible suspect who witnesses said fired a semiautomatic pistol at the teenagers as they stood together in front of 472 Marcy Avenue. The cause of the shooting, the police said, appeared to be an increasingly familiar one — a dispute between gangs from rival housing projects.AdvertisementThe 18-year-old victim, Mario Lopez, had gotten caught up with the wrong group of friends, a relative said, and had belonged to a local gang.AdvertisementEven so, his brother Terrence Morales said, “everybody’s going to miss him.” He said Mr. Lopez had many friends and talked of wanting to enlist in the Army. “I don’t know why these things happen,” Mr. Morales, 20, said. “Everybody knew him. He was cool with everyone.”The police said he and two other victims appeared to have been members of the Young Stackers gang; the fourth victim, the 15-year-old, belonged to the Marcy Gangsters. The two groups were enmeshed in a violent dispute with another gang, Tompkins Get Money, mostly made up of young men from the Tompkins Houses, fewer than two blocks from the crime scene.Such battles between teenagers — which the police say is often over territory and respect rather than drugs or money — account for many of the city’s shootings, rattling neighborhoods throughout the city.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At a nearby basketball court, a teenager shot baskets and shook his head when asked about the violence.As the sun set behind the buildings and the air promised a bit of relief from the heat, more teenagers arrived for pickup games a few hundred feet from where Saturday’s shooting occurred.When the gunfire broke out, many young people from the Marcy Houses were playing a scrimmage game there, part of a two-month-long basketball tournament for 8- to 21-year-olds in the neighborhood.“It saves them from being involved in a whole lot of other activities that they shouldn’t be involved in,” said Arey Robinson, 50, a former resident of the Marcy Houses who helped put together the tournament. “I’m trying to grab ahold of them before they slip.”A version of this article appears in print on July 8, 2013, on Page A19 of the We’re interested in your feedback on this page. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/"">Go to Home Page »</a>"

An 18-year-old boy is dead and three other teens were shot all because this defendant decided to commit senseless and terrible acts of violence. Now he will pay for what he did by being locked up for most of his life.”The District Attorney identified the defendant as Brandon Reese, 21, of Brooklyn. He was today sentenced by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Sheryl Parker to 47 years to life in prison following his conviction earlier this month on one count of second-degree murder, one count of second-degree attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, one count of first-degree attempted assault, one count of second-degree assault, one count of second-degree attempted assault, one count of first-degree reckless endangerment, and two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon following a jury trial.The District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, on July 6, 2013, at approximately 6:30 p.m., at the Marcy Houses, located at 472 Marcy Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, during a basketball tournament two rival crews engaged in a dispute which ultimately resulted in a shooting.The District Attorney said that, according to trial testimony, a number of gang members from Bushwick Houses, who belong to a crew named Young Stackers (YS), were hanging out in front of Marcy Houses. A member of Stack Money Goonz (SMG) walked by and realized that one of the YS’s had previously pulled a gun on him. He then called his older brother, the defendant, Brandon Reese, for back-up.The District Attorney further said that, according to trial testimony, after an argument ensued between his brother and the YS kids, the defendant pulled his gun from his waistband and fired approximately nine shots. Mario Lopez was shot approximately eight times and pronounced dead later that evening. Three others were injured: A 13-year-old shot in the neck with the bullet exiting his nose was left with permanent partial paralysis of his face; a second 13-year-old was shot in the knee; a 15-year-old was grazed on the hip and suffered minor injuries.The case was investigated by now retired New York City Police Detective James Tischler and other detectives assigned to the NYPD’s 79The case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Chavis, Chief of the District Attorney’s Violent Criminal Enterprises Bureau, with the assistance of Assistant District Attorney Iris Das, under the supervision of Executive Assistant District Attorney William E.

437,490793,"FT LAUDERDALE (CBSMiami) – One man was killed, three others injured, when they were shot in a robbery attempt in Pompano Beach over night.The four men were playing dominoes outside a Pompano Beach home in the 1600 block of NW 7th Lane around 1 a.m. Sunday when four armed individuals tried to rob them, according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office.“The gun was at my head.  And it missed my head and hit me in each arm and in one leg.  And I’m still able to walk.  I’m still breathing,” said one of the men who was shot but did not wish to be identified in this report. He said they were all sitting around playing when they heard footsteps.  Suddenly four men stood over them and demand their money. “There was nothing to give in the first place.  But they just said ‘give it up’.  So we just sat there we were looking at each other, is it a joke?  And they started shooting at us,” said the man.“We were watching a YouTube video and we heard a few gunshots go off and we immediately just froze for a minute, like what is going on? We thought it was some fireworks,” said neighbor Samuel Jennings. “Everybody was panicking. One dude was shot in the side. He ran inside the house.”Joshua Childs, 23, was pronounced dead on the scene. Alphonso Wright, 54, and Christopher Singleton, 35, were taken by fire rescue to Broward Health North.Rashaad Payne, 23, who immediately ran when the gunfire erupted was driven by a relative to the same hospital. All are expected to survive.“It was crazy because I actually opened up the door and seen one of the dudes lying on the ground. I walked over and looked at the garage and saw another dude lying on the ground. I was like ‘Wow, I can’t believe that this really happened’,” said Jennings.Broward Sheriff’s Office spokesman Mike Jachles said the individuals they are looking for should be considered extremely dangerous.“This was nothing short of a brazen attempt of four people who have no regard for human life. They were playing dominoes,” said Jachles. “They were not bothering anybody. They attempted to rob them.”Jennings said the shooting really shook him up. He was playing dominoes on Saturday in the spot where the shooting happened. He said it could very well have been him in the hospital – or worse.“I normally have my boys out here and we outside and everything too. So I’m just happy none of my boys was around when this happen because it could have been bigger than it actually turned out to be,” said Jennings.Unfortunately none of the three injured men were able to provide a good description of their attackers.“They had skullies on their head and bandanas around their face.  I only know that they were all black males and they wore dark clothes.  One of them had a big assault rifle and the rest of them had handguns,” said the man.The sheriff’s office hopes someone steps forward and helps them solve this case before it happens again.“They are armed. They are dangerous. We need to get them off the streets. They’ve killed, injured. They can do it again,” said Jachles.Anyone with information about the case should call Broward Crime Stoppers at (954) 493-TIPS (8477).Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:

A gunman opened fire on two men. One  died at 4:45 a.m., while the other is listed in stable condition. The victims’ names have not been released.At 3:45 this afternoon, four men were shot in West Baltimore’s Harlem Park neighborhood, according to police, who have not released their names or condition, though all are believed to have survived the attack.The shootings took place on Carrollton Avenue, near Harlem Avenue, just four blocks from Bennett Place, an alley street that has been the scene of three murders so far this year.Mayor Rawlings-Blake addresses the role of illegal guns at a press conference on June 26. Police Chief Batts is at her right. (Photo by Mark Reutter)The uptick in violence – nearly 50 shot since June 21 and 19 killed – has been attributed to the drug trade and turf battles between rival gangs by Police Chief Anthony Batts.<strong>Began in late June</strong>The shooting spree – the worst in the city in many years – has become the biggest challenge yet faced by Batts, who was hired nine months ago by Mayor Rawlings-Blake to run the police force.A palpable sense of fear and revulsion by many city residents – capped by a 10-mile march last Friday on North Avenue by 600 men – is also a blow to the prestige of the mayor, who has pledged crime reduction to be her No. 1 priority.Tonight’s safety walk was announced by the mayor’s office before the latest shootings in West Baltimore. She is scheduled to be at the walk for about an hour.The spike in violence began on Friday, June 22, when the mayor was attending a five-day conference of mayors in Las Vegas. Returning to the city on June 26, she noted at a press conference Last week, she led a safety walk through the McElderry Park neighborhood in East Baltimore, near a quadruple shooting that left 18-year-old Donyae Jones dead.The mayor has repeatedly called on the community to help police find and lock up the perpetrators, while Chief Batts told reporters on June 26 that He faulted his office for not releasing more information about police efforts to find the murderers. He also disclosed that he had demoted chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi following his comment that the department was overall satisfied “with the way the city is headed, violence-wise.”Since then, official information from the police has been relatively scant, but last week the city registered the lowest weekly number of homicides (three) since the end of May, and there was a sense that the worst of the violence was over."

Baltimore police have arrested a man they believe may be linked to as many as four shootings that left a total of seven people injured in less than a week in the city’s Harlem Park neighborhood in early July. Lamont Jones, 29, of West Baltimore, was taken into custody July 14 in connection with the July 9 shooting of four people in the 600 block of N. Carrollton Ave. He is charged with attempted murder and other charges for each of the four victims.  During a July 16 news conference, Baltimore City Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters that police were assisted by “tips and people in the neighborhood.” “Four people were shot on this block,” Batts said at the news conference, which was held at the scene of the violence. “Lamont tried to take the lives of citizens on our block.” The brazen daytime shooting shook local residents. According to police, bullets flew at about 2:45 p.m. on an afternoon when many local residents were sitting on their stoops and children were playing outside.  When police arrived on the scene, they found two men lying on a stoop, another in the middle of the street and a fourth lying on his own front porch. Each had been shot, police said. According to witnesses, the man in the street had been gunned down as he attempted to run away. None of the victims have been identified by police. “All the dudes that got shot were my buddies,” said Keith Gillman, who lives on the block. “I heard gunshots and saw my dude ‘Pop’ laying on his step…and my other two buddies ‘Lil’ Troy’ and ‘Homicide,’ who ran in the 700 block and then fell to the ground.” Gillman told the  Batts said the shooting is indicative of the violence sweeping the western district of the city.  “This neighborhood is on fire,” Batts said. “I’ve been out here a lot and talking to the neighborhoods. The neighbors provided a tremendous amount of data for us to follow up on. Half way through the year and the city has been faced with multiple shootings in areas of concern.” Batts said local residents are frustrated that people are being killed in their neighborhoods. “They are…concerned that people are terrorizing their neighborhoods,” he said. On the day of the shooting, resident Yvette Sarabia, who moved to the neighborhood three months ago, told the  “I have four kids and I don’t allow them to go outside,” she said. As of July 15, 126 people had been murdered in Baltimore this year, compared to 111 at the same time last year. During the same period this year, the city tallied 219 people shot, compared to 192 in 2012, according to police. Batts told reporters that police recently received tips that the Black Guerilla Family is trying to move into Harlem Park.  “I will be out here and we will root out the problems that are impacting the young kids and their safety in their neighborhoods,” Batts pledged.

440,490909,"Baltimore City police have arrested a man in a quadruple shooting last week in west Baltimore.Police Commissioner Anthony Batts is trying to send a message that neighborhoods willing to talk have his ear.Lamont Jones, 29, faces 35 criminal charges related to last Tuesday's shooting of four men in west Baltimore. They were sitting on steps in the 600 block of North Carrollton Avenue near Edmondson Avenue. The men suffered injuries that were not considered life-threatening.Investigators said Jones and another man approached the victims wearing construction vests and hats, and they started shooting. According to the police commissioner, the motive was personal.""This is a modern day Hatfield and McCoys. All of these people have been related or somehow connected to each other, and what we are doing is peeling them apart and bringing them to justice,"" Batts said.Jones is charged with the shooting of the four men. Police said they believe two other cases that happened nearby -- two homicides on the same block -- are related.Batts promised to next go after two drug houses on the North Carrollton block. He credited the community with stepping up with information.""I walked out here personally myself and talked with neighbors. They are sharing information. They are concerned about their neighborhood and concerned with people terrorizing their neighborhood, and (they) don't want to put up with it anymore,"" the police commissioner said.Police confirmed the highly-sought ""What the rumor mill is, he is an enforcer or a hit man for the Black Guerrilla Family. He is tied to a number of violent incidents, not just one,"" Batts said.He said the quadruple shooting is also linked to the BGF gang. The organization is believed to be responsible for the surge in violence in the past month.

The whole thing was just packed with cars and bikes.

We heard gunshots and then we looked out the window and we just see people running in front of the window and we just locked the door. You know everyone was trying to come inside,” said Nasir.Nasir says people who were at the party told him the ones that came up shooting were not invited guests.“They didn’t expect it. You could tell the people that were hurt didn’t expect it,” said Nasir.Nasir says The Oak Room is rented out most weekend nights, but that he’s never witnessed anything like this before.He says the parking lot entrances were blocked and they were charging $10 to get into the party, so he’s not sure how the shooters made their way inside.Authorities identified the victims Monday morning.Officials say 42-year-old Kevin Miller, of Antlers, died after being taken to a local hospital.Three others were injured including 22-year-old Aaron Wayne Brown, 41-year-old Joe Brown and 33-year-old Michael Hogue.Investigators say the gunfire was exchanged between many of the victims and no arrests have been made in the case.At this time, they say they are not looking for any other suspects.<strong>Filed in:</strong>

Two people have been arrested in connection with the death of a man in a gang shootout, culminating an investigation that stretched for more than a year.Marquel Dean, already in prison on unrelated crimes, was arrested this week on suspicion of first-degree murder in the July 14, 2013, killing of 27-year-old James Gary, said Lt. Jeff Gilmore, head of the Wichita Police Department’s gang unit.A second suspect, Shane Landrum, 32, was arrested in Texas in connection with Gary’s death. He was booked into the Sedgwick County Jail shortly before 8 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of first-degree murder and is being held on a $500,000 bond.Dean, 28, was booked into the Sedgwick County Jail shortly before noon Wednesday following his transfer from the prison in Hutchinson. He is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder and being a felon in possession of a firearm. His bond is also $500,000.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.The shootout occurred at about 3:20 a.m. July 14 in the 800 block of East 11th Street, during an after-hours warehouse party at an auto repair shop. The owner was renting the warehouse out for parties held after the clubs in Old Town close.Gary died in the shooting. Four other people were injured, two critically.“It is a gang-related homicide case,” Gilmore said Thursday. “It has been a very long and complex investigation” involving several different law enforcement agencies.Gilmore called the arrests “very gratifying … very satisfying.”“To get sufficient evidence took a lot of work, a lot of interviewing numerous, numerous witnesses,” he said.The shooting was the byproduct of a long-running gang feud, Lt. James Espinoza said. Dean, Landrum and Gary are all “hard-core, documented gang members,” he said.“I cannot comment enough on the relentless hours that investigators worked on this,” Espinoza said.Dean has a criminal history that includes convictions for aggravated assault, aggravated battery and aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer, according to the Kansas Department of Corrections.

No arrests have been announced and police don’t have a motive for the attack.The shooting happened in the 3400 block of Wilson Avenue, which runs between Montana Street and MacArthur Boulevard in the lower Dimond District neighborhood, just north of Interstate 580. At least a half-dozen bullet holes could be seen Thursday in the front door and the living-room carpet was stained with blood. Khamel Hardin, 22, who lives in the apartment, identified the other three victims as his mother, Clara Field, niece Amara York, 7, and nephew Antoine York, 4. His sister, 28-year-old Brea Colbert, is the mother of Amara and Antoine and also lives there, he said. She was not home at the time of the shooting, police said.Hardin said he was in the living room with the children when he heard gunshots and saw a shot pierce the door and “whiz” through the air. “It was like a bomb, explosion,” said Hardin. “I was dodging shots. I tried to get them out of the way.”Police said Alaysha lives in Oakland and was at the apartment for a sleepover with her friend, Amara. Hardin said the girl frequently visited the home because the girls attended school together. He said he had no clue why anyone would target the home.An Oakland Unified School District spokesman confirmed Alaysha was a student at Fruitvale Elementary School, where staff were visibly shaken Thursday morning and one worker broke down when asked about Alaysha.Alaysha’s stepfather, Jesse Fowler, said he cannot believe she is gone. “It’s a shocker to me,” Fowler told television station ABC7. “It hit me earlier at the hospital. I’m still in denial that she is really gone.“I’m used to her talking my ear off and she is not going to be there anymore. She has a younger brother who I have to raise without her now, so this is going to be difficult.”Fowler had to tell Alaysha’s mother what happened, because she was out of town on vacation. She is now on her way back to Oakland, he said.Fowler said that the night before her death, Alaysha asked him to walk with her to her best friend’s door. Fowler asked her if she was too big for that and she said no, so he walked her to the door.That was the last conversation he had with his stepdaughter, he said.In a photograph released by the family on Thursday, Alaysha is shown in a bright green sweatshirt decorated with a multicolored butterfly and the words “Peace, Love and Hope.”Outside the family’s front door on Thursday, neighbors created a makeshift memorial comprised of flowers and cards.Deangelo Anderson, 24, arrived at Wilson Avenue with other members of East Oakland’s Victory Baptist Church on Thursday to pray for victims and their families. “It has to stop,” Anderson said of the violence. “The kids can’t even play out front anymore. They have to be locked up and that’s not fair. They’re just children.“We can’t depend on anyone else to change our city. It’s got to start with the youth. It’s got to start with us.” John Hughes, who lives in the same neighborhood, already knows the pain Alaysha’s family is experiencing. Three years ago, his own son was shot and killed.“I know what she’s going through,” Hughes said. “It’s about old grown folks older than these kids killing these little kids. They’re killing off our future and we need to do something about it.”Police were asking for the public’s help in the case. “We really need the community to help in tracking down the suspect in this heinous and shocking crime,” said Investigating Officer Rob Rosin.Alaysha, the youngest person to be killed in the city so far this year, was one of seven children fatally shot in Oakland. The other six were all age 17. Her death marked Oakland’s 54th homicide of the year.Police and CrimeStoppers of Oakland are offering up to $25,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of suspects.

			Trending:		OAKLAND — Two suspected gang members have been charged with murder in the shooting death of an 8-year-old girl killed while answering the front door during a sleepover in July, authorities said Tuesday. Authorities said suspected gunman Darnell Williams, 22, and Joe Carroll, 27, who apparently planned the July 17 attack that left Alaysha Carradine dead, intended to seek revenge for the killing of Carroll’s cousin, 26-year-old Jermaine Davis, in Berkeley earlier that day. Williams and Carroll were each charged with murder, three counts of attempted murder and shooting at an inhabited dwelling. Prosecutors will decide whether to seek the death penalty against Williams, who was embarking on a brutal crime spree when he killed the girl, investigators said.Williams is also accused of killing a man who he attempted to rob during a dice game in Berkeley in September, authorities said.“Some crimes rock the agency and the community; they affect us forever. This is one,” said Oakland police Assistant Chief Paul Figueroa. “Killing an 8-year-old is as despicable as it gets.”Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said the suspects went to the Wilson Avenue apartment intent on killing someone they believed was responsible for Davis’ killing and “did not care” who was inside when they opened fire. Court documents show the suspects knew that their intended target’s children and their mother lived in the Dimond District apartment. Carradine was staying at her friend’s house.Williams, after orchestrating the killing with Carroll, rang the doorbell at 11:18 p.m.; as soon as Alaysha’s friend, a 7-year-old girl, opened the door, he started shooting, O’Malley said. The bullets pierced the apartment’s metal gate and hit four of the five people inside. Alaysha was killed and her friend, a 4-year-old boy and their 64-year-old grandmother were wounded.Carroll was arrested Sept. 27 in Houston, and Williams was arrested Sept. 8 by Berkeley police.Williams and Laquana Nuno are also charged with the Sept. 8 killing of Anthony Medearis in the 1400 block of Eighth Street in West Berkeley. Williams was shooting dice with Medearis and others when he decided to rob Medearis, according to court papers.Williams shot Medearis, and in the process, a bullet fragment struck Williams’ 7-year-old nephew in the face, documents show. Nuno agreed to be a getaway driver for Williams, and fled police after Williams jumped out of her car, authorities said.Williams was arrested later that night, found hiding in a shed, according to police.Carroll and three other suspected gang members — Joseph Connors, Emando Roos and Travon Wilson — were also charged with conspiring to murder two men who Carroll believed had disrespected him and his brother, authorities said. Information developed during the course of the investigation into Alaysha’s death allowed police to prevent the killing, including when some of the men were stalking the targets at an unnamed Oakland nightclub, authorities said.Nuno, Connors, Roos and Wilson were arrested Saturday after police served search warrants in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward.Speaking at a news conference announcing the arrests, O’Malley said the killing of Alaysha “shocked all of us” and showed the ‘disregard for human life” that gang members have.She singled out Oakland police homicide investigator Officer Rob Rosin, who headed the case, for bringing it to a successful conclusion.Mayor Jean Quan said Alaysha’s killing “really broke my heart” and said she hopes the arrests “will send a signal” that violent crime will not be tolerated.Alaysha, whose family called her “Ladybug,” would have started third grade at Fruitvale Elementary School in August. Her death was Oakland’s 54th homicide this year, and she is one of the youngest Oakland homicide victims this year.Less than three weeks after Alaysha’s death, 16-month-old Drew Jackson was shot and killed, along with his 20-year-old father, as the two slept next to each other at an aunt’s East Oakland home.Get Morning Report and other email newsletters"
465,491073,"  The shooting happened Friday morning near Yosemite Avenue and Cleveland in Madera.  The driver of a Red Honda Civic made it several miles to Madera Community Hospital after he and three passengers were shot at the intersection of Cleveland and Yosemite.  ""The victims vehicle was traveling Southbound on Cleveland when an unknown black vehicle, compact pulled up alongside the right side of the vehicle and fired several shots into the victims vehicle, hitting all four passengers,"" said Johnnie Smith with the Madera Police Department.   For several hours, while crime scene processors collected evidence, incoming patients were diverted to another entrance while detectives looked for clues.

Officers are hoping to collect additional evidence at the crime scene to solve the case.

									July 21, 2013 A gunman opened fire in a Brooklyn park yesterday in a senseless act of revenge — wounding five people, including two bystanders sitting on a porch, witnesses and officials said.The shooter, accompanied by three other men and two women, fired multiple times at a crowd at Hope Ballfield in Bushwick at around 2:15 p.m., witnesses said.The shooter was at large, but witnesses said cops did nab a unidentified man when he returned to the scene to retrieve the discarded gun.Rolando Pizarro, 45, the intended target, was shot in the abdomen as he walked with his wife, Melody Amil, 37, and son, Rolando Jr., 22, who were each struck in a leg, witnesses said.Wanda Espinoza, 52, was shot in the stomach as she sat outside her house. She was with Manuel Rivera, 62, who was hit in a leg. All of the victims were listed as being in stable condition last night, authorities said.Pizarro was targeted for filing a police report Friday against the shooter. He was angry at the thug for harassing his daughter at a McDonald’s where she works, his family said. The gunman and several pals flirted with the 18-year-old girl behind the counter at the Knickerbocker Avenue location. When she refused their advances, one of the men threw a milkshake in her face, her family said.“They were making advances and teasing her and harassing her,” said family friend Ivette Miranda, 45. “She called her dad, and he went there, to the McDonald’s, and called the cops. He filed a police report right there. “Those guys are bad men,” Miranda added. “They wanted to get back at Rolando.”Pizarro told the man to stay away from his daughter, according to a manager at the restaurant.Four of the victims were rushed to Elmhurst Hospital, while Amil was taken to Kings County Hospital.Amil’s sister, Lisa, was in a nearby park watching her son, Hector, 8, play with his Little League baseball team.“Melody was shot in the knee. She’ll be OK,” Lisa said. “I can’t believe they would shoot into a street full of people,” she added. “This is just over a girl or something. “It’s just so senseless.”

In the days before his death, Pedro Alberto Vargas watched movie after movie involving shootings, seeking creative inspiration for his own draft screenplay.The infatuation worried his elderly mother, who recounted her son’s actions to a relative shortly after Vargas shot and killed six neighbors on July 26.“He has mental problems, like disorders or related to nerves?” an operator asked 83-year-old Esperanza Patterson in a 911 call hours before the rampage.“No, no,” Patterson said. “But what he is doing is writing novels.”No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Exactly how Vargas, 42, went from being a dedicated son, avid gym-goer and talented graphic designer to the enraged man behind one of the worst massacres in Hialeah history may always remain a mystery.But from a review of public records and interviews with people who knew him emerges a portrait of a troubled loner who over the past five years appeared to have developed a pattern of anonymously harassing his former co-workers.His habit was discovered three days before the shooting. He faced no significant consequences — yet he couldn’t let the matter go.“He possibly took his motives to the grave,” said Carl Zogby, a Hialeah police spokesman.Vargas was born in Havana on Oct. 3, 1970, the only child to teachers who lived on 16th Street in the city’s Vedado suburb. To many in his family he was known as Albertico. His father, who taught literature, died in 1991 or 1992, according to testimony Vargas gave in a July 23 deposition.Between 1990 and 1994, Vargas studied at the University of Pedagogical Sciences in Havana, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in technical education with a focus on construction, transcripts show. His best grades were in English and physical education.He briefly lived with a girlfriend, though they never married. After his father’s death, Vargas and his mother moved in with his grandmother, a relative of Patterson’s said.The family that moved into their vacated Havana apartment complained about how filthy it was, asking if the previous tenants had kept pigs in the bathroom, according to a former Vargas neighbor in Havana who asked not to be identified.Vargas’ mother won a U.S. visa lottery in 1995 and left for Miami, where she had a sister. Vargas himself won the same lottery two years later and moved to Miami on May 2, 1997. He was 26 years old. Mother and son eventually became U.S. citizens.“It was just lucky,” Vargas said in the deposition. “We wanted, like everybody, to leave Cuba and come here, looking for freedom and better possibilities, work.”In 1999, Vargas and his mother moved into the one-bedroom Hialeah apartment at 1485 W. 46th St. where they would live for the next 14 years.He began taking classes at Miami Dade College, graduating in 2004 with an associate’s degree in graphic design and a 3.5 grade-point average.As a student, Vargas worked briefly at a now-shuttered print shop and interned at the University of Miami, where he helped design a media guide for an athletic team. Even then he cared for his mother, a former UM intern coordinator said Friday, describing Vargas as an intense perfectionist.“He was extremely mature and responsible,” said the coordinator, who asked not to be identified.Upon graduating in 2004, Vargas went to work for the media services department at MDC’s North Campus. Yet he continued to live with his mother, splitting rent and utility expenses, Vargas testified in the deposition.He slept on the couch most nights, though sometimes he slept next to his mother in the only bed in the apartment.“They lived in their own world,” said the mother’s relative, who asked not to be identified. “She adored her son. To her, he was such a good young man, he loved her so much.” Twelve numbered Post-it notes found in Vargas’ apartment last week appeared to be a storyboard, perhaps for his planned screenplay.“Louie’s home,” one of them says. “Very Spartan. Louie f--- the whore ... Louie ask her to stay she refuses unless he pays for the rest of the night. Louie insults her.”Though Vargas dreamed of buying his own house, the relative said, he didn’t want to leave his mother, particularly after she had knee surgery. Yet she had been on a Miami-Dade waiting list for public housing for herself since 2008, records show, and had applied for housing assistance on seven occasions in Hialeah since 1996, wanting her son to build his own life.Bank statements obtained by El Nuevo Herald show Vargas had more than $92,000 in a savings account a year ago. But he lived poorly in a dingy apartment with aged furniture and often wore dirty clothes to the several local LA Fitness gyms he frequented to lift weights for hours.A gym acquaintance, Jorge Bagos, said the bald Vargas once complained he lost his hair through steroid use. A toxicology screen performed as part of his autopsy is pending.Vargas had a concealed weapons permit and owned a Glock 9mm semiautomatic pistol he carried with him when he drove at night, he said in the deposition. He didn’t explain where he went, noting only that he did not frequent bars.His career at Miami Dade College went smoothly at first, according to his personnel file, which includes his Cuban and American college transcripts. In work references, colleagues described Vargas as hard-working and talented.“Pedro’s work is top-notch,” wrote one of his graphic design instructors, Elio Arteaga.Arteaga, who now works at DeVry University in Broward, remembered Friday that one assignment required students to design a “DVD interface” for a movie of their choice. Vargas picked  But despite his talent, said Arteaga, who was visited Thursday evening by Hialeah police digging into Vargas’ past, Vargas “was a little bit socially awkward.”Other co-workers called Vargas quiet and buff, often drinking protein shakes at lunch.Vargas’ performance evaluations were positive until his last year on the job, when a new supervisor wrote that Vargas was difficult to work with.He “lacks social skills,” Elmo Lugo wrote. “It is hard for him to accept change.”Vargas responded with a letter saying his job description had been unfairly expanded to include managerial work. Attached were three emails from MDC employees who lauded Vargas’ graphic design work. But Vargas didn’t get along with everybody, said Nick Murrell, who used to organize special MDC events for which Vargas designed printed materials.“He was always very cordial to me, very polite, very respectable,” Murrell said. But with colleagues he didn’t care for, Vargas could be “abrasive, rude and curt.”“There was a second personality that was evident,” he added. “But just because somebody is a little off doesn’t mean they’re going to go and shoot somebody. I never would have believed that he was capable of something so horrible.”Vargas was forced to resign in 2008 after MDC found he had downloaded inappropriate files from the Internet, including several related to sex and seduction and a computer hacking tutorial that linked to the Anarchist Cookbook, a manual for assembling homemade explosives. Vargas disputed the allegations.Several months after his resignation, at least two of his former MDC supervisors reported receiving anonymous threats via email, texts and Facebook. Though they suspected Vargas, police were only able to trace the messages to a Hialeah public library.Vargas then went to work as a graphic designer for another Miami company, but was fired after three months. Employees from that firm also received anonymous emails, according to a source familiar with the case. Managers suspected the recently fired Vargas, but police were unable to identify the emails’ origin.In May 2012, Vargas, through a temp agency, began working at Bullet Line, a promotional products company. He was let go in October after Bullet Line said it no longer had enough work to require Vargas’ services.Weeks later, several Bullet Line employees began receiving troubling messages. The company reported the problem to police — and hired an attorney, Angel Castillo Jr., to investigate.Castillo sued Yahoo to try to determine the anonymous user sending the emails. Through the lawsuit, he obtained records from the John F. Kennedy Library in Hialeah, where the emails originated.Castillo looked for former Bullet Line employees who used the library’s computers on the days the emails were sent. Vargas’ name popped up most frequently.Several hours into his July 23 testimony, Vargas admitted to authoring the messages. Castillo told him he would close the case if Vargas wrote an apology to his former co-workers and promised not to send any more messages. Vargas sent the apology four hours later.“It is time for me to show maturity and a promise not to repeat this mistake ever again,” he wrote. But Vargas continued to worry about the case. He told his mother he feared losing his money, the mother’s relative said.At 1:37 p.m. on July 26, a perturbed Vargas called 911 to report someone was following him and he was the victim of  His mother told 911 her son had been acting strangely. She thought he needed a psychiatric evaluation. Police dispatched two officers but called them back after the mother said Vargas had left with a container to buy gasoline.Vargas visited the Kendall office of Castillo, who was out. Police believe Vargas was intent on killing the lawyer.When Vargas returned home, carrying the gasoline and a bag full of cash, he set fire to the money. His mother suffered burns trying to put out the flames with her feet. The smoke prompted 911 calls and a visit to apartment 408 from the building’s husband-and-wife managers, Italo and Samira Pisciotti, 79 and 69, respectively.Vargas shot them dead.Paramedics and police officers pulled up outside minutes later. Vargas shot at them from his balcony but missed, instead hitting 33-year-old Carlos Gavilanes, who was entering the building across the street. He died next to his unharmed 9-year-old son.Vargas then made his way to apartment 304, kicked in the locked door and killed Patricio Simono, 64; his girlfriend, Merly Niebles, 51, and her daughter, Priscilla Perez, 17. Priscilla had been hiding in the bathtub.In apartment 523, Vargas took Sarrida and Zoeb Nek hostage. Police negotiated with him for four hours before charging in, killing Vargas in a gunfight and rescuing the hostages.Vargas, wearing a white undershirt, blue plaid long-sleeved shirt and jeans, was trying to reload his pistol, police said, and had two full magazines of ammunition.His mother, the relative said, has been hospitalized and is devastated.“She carries the pain of her son, but also the pain of the people who died,” the relative said. “She’s crying all the time.”On Friday, nearly a week after the shooting, Vargas’ body lay in the Miami-Dade medical examiner’s office.No one had claimed it for burial.

Officer Michael Hewitt with the Indianapolis Metro Police Department said none of the injuries appear to be life-threatening.</span>Officers handcuffed a man shortly after arriving at the scene. According to the police report, the shooter waved down an officer and told him he pulled the trigger. He said he’d done it all in self-defense because the people he shot were trying to attack him and had already attacked one of his friends.Investigators said they found four people suffering from gunshot wounds on the sidewalk on Broad Ripple Avenue in front of The Wild Beaver Saloon. All four of the injured were men between the ages of 24 and 30. Emergency crews took them to area hospitals. One had a serious injury from a bullet hitting his upper leg.The shooting happened around the corner on College Avenue in area of The Vogue. Officers recovered a nine millimeter handgun from the car of the man who identified himself as the shooter.Officer Hewitt said it wasn’t clear if the shooter or the victims had been at another nightclub nearby. The crime scene was crowded as hundreds of people were leaving bars and clubs in the area.Witnesses told Fox59 they heard a man claiming he had been punched in the face just before the shots started.The incident is classified as an aggravated assault, but charges had yet to be filed as of Friday morning.<strong>Filed in:</strong><strong>Topics:</strong>

495,491609,"Authorities are combing the scene of last night's deadly shooting at the Ross Township Municipal Building in the Poconos, and they have scheduled an 11:30 a.m. news conference to provide further details.Three people were killed and four others were hospitalized when authorities say township resident Rockne Warren Newell opened fire at a crowded township supervisors meeting around 7:25 p.m.Newell has had and ongoing dispute with township authorities for over a decade about his ramshackle Flyte Road property. Newell has items scattered throughout the property and the township has tried for years to force him to clean it up.Newell is now in police custody and officers have his road blocked off while they search his property.Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine was at the scene Tuesday morning talking with state police investigators at the Municipal Building, which is surrounded by lush green hills and sits next to a large open park.Authorities at the building, located near the Route 33 Saylorsburg interchange, said they may release the names of the victims at Tuesday morning's news conference.State police at Lehighton said Newell began firing a rifle through the windows of the Municipal Building on Anchorage Road, where between 15 and 18 people were gathered for the supervisors meeting.Newell, who officials said had a long-running dispute with the township over his property, entered the building and continued to fire the rifle, state police said. He then left the building, where he retrieved a handgun from a vehicle, returned to the building and continued shooting, police said.Newell, 59, had recently been removed from his property at 293 Flyte Road, after township officials condemned it for code violations, state police said.Two of the victims died at the scene, while the third died at St. Luke's University Hospital-Fountain Hill after being flown there by helicopter. A fourth victim was reportedly in surgery at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest late Monday night after being taken there by helicopter.Monroe County Coroner Bob Allen said he would not release the identities of the victims who died at the scene until their relatives are notified.Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grim has not released details who died at St. Luke's Hospital.The gunman, who suffered a gunshot wound, was hospitalized at Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg. According to a Pocono Record reporter's first-person account of the shooting, Newell was injured when a township official turned the gunman's own weapon against him,One person suffered a graze wound from a bullet. Another person was hospitalized with what state police described as a ""stress-related"" illness, police said.State police Capt. Edward Hoke said at a briefing at the Monroe County 911 Center in Hamilton Township that Newell was subdued by a member of the public and the township official, who reportedly shot Newell.""It was certainly courageous what they did,"" Hoke said. ""They absolutely would have saved lives. He was entering the building again with a handgun and his intent had been shown to do harm to people, and certainly if they would not have done that he would have injured other people.""Hoke said police were working to obtain a search warrant to obtain evidence from Newell's former home.Hoke said Newell has been removed from his home Thursday because of issues related to the lack of sewer service on the property. There was nothing on the agenda of the supervisors meeting related to his property.Hoke noted that Newell had arrived at the meeting in a car with Texas license plates. Police were also working to obtain a warrant to search the car and obtain the rifle allegedly used in the shooting.The handgun that Newell allegedly used was recovered from the scene by police.For more than a decade, Newell has been in a dispute with the township over the property, which was littered with cast-off building parts, junk cars and other debris. Newell said in an interview at the time the items were like a museum collection.Court records show the township obtained an $8,000 judgment against Newell in district court. The nature of the township's lawsuit against Newell is unclear in court records.Pocono Record reporter Chris Reber, who was covering the meeting, reported seeing bullet holes appear in the walls and a string of shots.""It was automatic, like a string of firecrackers. That's what everyone said,"" Reber wrote.After an initial round of shooting, the gunman went to the parking lot and returned with another weapon, police said.Reber said a township official who was tending to a wounded man was able to wrestle the shooter to the ground and shot the gunman with his own gun.<i><a href=""mailto:peter.hall@mcall.com"">peter.hall@mcall.com</a></i><i>610-820-6581</i>"
496,491609,"STROUDSBURG — A Monroe County man pleaded guilty Friday to homicide for gunning down three people at a 2013 municipal government meeting because he was angry about being forced off his debris-strewn land.Rockne Newell was sentenced to three consecutive life prison terms, plus 61 to 122 years. Relatives of the victims looked on as he changed his plea three months after a judge ruled that the 61-year-old disabled junk dealer was competent to stand trial.Judge Joseph P. Cronin Jr. read a narrative written by prosecutors that detailed Newell's alleged actions, and asked Newell if he agreed. Newell simply said ""yes,"" Monroe County District Attorney David Christine said.Given the chance to speak, Newell began what sounded like an apology to the wife of one of his victims, and then changed course. For the next 40 minutes, he talked about his perceived victimization that led to the shootings, Christine said.""He believed there was a conspiracy to deprive him of his rights, and all he wanted to do was live on his property,"" Christine said.In the months leading up to the shootings, Ross Township officials had condemned Newell's property and then bought it at a sheriff's sale, saying he owed thousands of dollars in fines and had generated complaints that he lived in a storage shed, built an illegal culvert and used a bucket outside as a toilet.Newell packed a rental car with guns and ammunition and drove to the August 2013 municipal meeting in Monroe County, authorities said.He used a Ruger Mini-14 rifle to blast a barrage of gunfire through a wall into the meeting room and fired at people trying to flee. When he ran out of ammunition, Newell retrieved a revolver from the car, and returned, but was tackled by two men attending the meeting and shot in the leg during the scuffle, authorities said.Ross Township zoning officer David Fleetwood, Gerard Kozic and James LaGuardia died of their injuries. Three others were wounded.The man charged with killing three people at a Ross Township meeting in 2013 has filed a federal lawsuit against Monroe County Correctional Facility, alleging he has been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment because the warden will not honor his request for special dietary foods.Attorneys...""I wish I killed more of them!"" Newell shouted when a state trooper arrived on the scene, the trooper said.During Newell's preliminary hearing in November 2013, prosecutors played audio of the shooting rampage and its aftermath. In it, Fleetwood told a 911 dispatcher that he'd been shot in the stomach and identified Newell as the shooter.""I can't move. … Please hurry, please hurry,"" he said.He died at St. Luke's University Hospital in Fountain Hill about an hour later.Linda Kozic, who was shot in the leg, could be heard urging her 53-year-old husband, Gerard, to breathe and ""stay with me.""In a jailhouse interview with the Pocono Record newspaper three weeks after the shootings, Newell said, ""I'm sorry innocent people got hurt, though I know 'sorry' doesn't fix anything."""
497,491630,"<strong>Montclair, N.J. (PIX11)</strong>Three of them are men in their 20’s who were shot in the leg, arm or backside but police say they are all in stable condition.The fourth friend is an 18-year-old Montclair girl who was shot in the chest and she is now breathing on a ventilator.“I heard five shots or six from a large weapon,” Bernard Rawls, a resident and local pastor in the Montclair block of Mission Street and Elmwood Avenue, said. As soon as he heard the shots, Rawls ran outside to help.“There were two young men on the porch” he said, “A woman was crying. She was the mother. I tended to the men then seeing he would be okay I consoled her.”PIX 11 News was first on the scene just after 1 a.m. this morning. Police say the gunman fired five to ten shots at the group of friends then ran away.They do not have a good description on the suspect because they say he was covered up, wearing some sort of mask.Montclair Police Deputy Chief said, “It is not a random act like someone came up and just started shooting up the street. That’s not the case.”Residents, like Jamela, who know the victims well, find that hard to believe. She did not want to be identified.“They are good kids. Loved music and sports and just tried to live their lives,” Jamela said.Pastor Rawls agrees to a point but says neighborhood kids have been troubled for awhile.“Look around, we have five churches on every corner. How did we failing our children?” he said.The pastor says he worries about retaliation now.Police say they are not strangers to the neighborhood. In fact, they responded to another shooting on the exact same block back in May.<strong>Filed in:</strong>Hi there everyone, it’s my first visit at this web page, and article is in fact fruitful for me, keep up posting these types of content.Comments are closed.

The woman is in serious condition, Essex County Chief of Detectives Anthony Ambrose said. The men have non-life threatening injuries.It's the third shooting in the neighborhood since June 1. Rev. Clenard Childress Jr., a pastor at New Cavalry Baptist Church, said, ""It's obviously ongoing; it's probably the same people.""An 18-year-old who refused to give his name said two of the victims fled after being shot and collapsed in front of his house on Mission Street.  The other two victims were found in the vicinity where they were shot. There were blood stains on the street and on the railing outside the house where the shooting took place. A woman who lives in the house said her son is a friend of one of the victims.""Over the past two years, it's just getting horrible,"" said Ta-Tanisha Harrell, who said she moved from East Orange so her children could live in a safer environment. ""If I wanted to be in the 'hood, I would have stayed in the 'hood.""""Instead, the 'hood came to me.""On June 1, there was another shooting on Mission Street, neighbors said.

500,491698,"A grenade-wielding man who police say shot two mothers and their daughters to death Wednesday had a history of family violence.But his criminal record was wiped clean after he’d graduated from a special program for veterans trying to get their lives back on track, and he may have lied to get into the program.Erbie Lee Bowser, 44, faces multiple capital murder charges after authorities say he killed his former girlfriend and her teenage daughter in southwest Dallas around 10:30 p.m. and then drove about 7 miles to DeSoto to kill his estranged wife and her daughter,Toya Smith, 43, and daughter Tasmia Allen, 17, were shot in Smith’s home in the 7100 block of Long Canyon Trail, near West Wheatland Road and Mountain Creek Parkway. Smith’s 14-year-old son, Storm Malone, and a 17-year-old family friend, Dasmine Mitchell, were shot. Both remain hospitalized. Dasmine underwent surgery and remains in critical condition.Bowser then went to the home of his 47-year-old estranged wife in the 100 block of Galleria Drive in DeSoto, busted down the back door, and tossed in a hand grenade, authorities said. The explosion “blew out the walls and a couple of windows,” said Cpl. Melissa Franks, a DeSoto police spokeswoman, but no one was hurt by the blast.Police said Bowser then entered the home and shot to death Zina Bowser and her daughter, Neima Williams, 28.Zina Bowser’s two young boys were also wounded by gunfire before the gunman apparently ran out of bullets. Her 13-year-old son was able to call police.Constance McKinney, who is the cousin and neighbor of Zina Bowser’s mother, said that the children, 10-year-old Myles and 13-year-old Chris, underwent surgery.“They’re doing as well as could be expected in their condition,” McKinney said.Williams’ 3-year-old was also at the home but was unharmed.When police arrived at the home on Galleria, Erbie Bowser pretended to be a victim. He seemed catatonic, only giving his name, military rank and serial number, police said.But police identified Bowser as their suspect and took him into custody. Officers confiscated a pocketknife from him.Veterans programBowser had a history of domestic violence, but it isn’t in his criminal record because he completed the Dallas County court program for veterans in the summer of 2012.Bowser entered the Veterans Court after attacking Zina Bowser at the home on Galleria in January 2011. She had filed for divorce and wanted him to move out, according to a protective order application she signed.They married in February 2010. Zina Bowser sought the divorce the following January, citing “cruel treatment,” discord or conflict of personalities and adultery.Bowser served in the Army from 1991 to 2000. Those who enter Veterans Court must demonstrate that their time in combat caused them to commit whatever crime they are accused of.Joe Lynch, a Vietnam War Army veteran who volunteered as Bowser’s mentor for Veterans Court, said Bowser told him he served in the 1990s in Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf, as well as during operations in Haiti and in war-torn Somalia.“Of all the veterans I’ve met over the years … he would have been the last one I expected this of,” said Lynch. Lynch said Bowser was always “friendly and forthcoming” when discussing his life.But on Thursday, the Army had no record of him being in combat, which should have made him ineligible for the program.State District Judge Mike Snipes, who started Dallas County’s Veterans Court in 2010, said he approved Bowser’s graduation from the program last summer.“The decision to allow him into the court and the decision to allow him to graduate were mine and mine alone,” Snipes said. “I don’t want anybody else to be blamed for anything.”Snipes declined to discuss Bowser or his case further. Lynch said he had believed Bowser was doing well and had benefited from the program.Smith, the former girlfriend Bowser is accused of killing before Zina Bowser on Wednesday, always came to court with him, Lynch said.“You’d rarely see” that kind of support, Lynch said. She would always say that “everything was going OK. He was doing what he was supposed to be doing.”Lynch said Snipes always asked Smith if Bowser had any problems that needed to be addressed.“‘Fine, judge,’” Lynch recalled Smith always saying. “No issues.”The family violence case no longer shows up in the criminal court system because Bowser graduated after undergoing intense drug testing, psychiatric care and anger management classes. The charge, believed to have been aggravated assault, was expunged.2011 incidentBut an affidavit alleging domestic violence survived the wiping of his record because it was attached to a January 2011 application for a protective order in a divorce case. The affidavit shows that Wednesday’s rampage was not the first time Bowser was accused of domestic violence.The estranged wife, Zina Bowser, signed an affidavit that said the 6-foot-7, 400-pound Bowser shoved her with his stomach and threatened to kill her and her children in January 2011.“He put his finger in my face and said, ‘I will bury you,’” Zina Bowser said in the sworn affidavit.She said she started to call 911, but he grabbed a pocketknife from the nightstand and said, “Call the police and I will execute your kids.”Zina Bowser’s divorce case languished and is no longer an active case.Erbie Bowser was being evaluated Thursday at Parkland Memorial Hospital.Brad Lollar, one of the attorneys appointed to represent him, said he did not yet know much about the case. “I haven’t talked to him yet,” said Lollar.Franks, the DeSoto officer, said earlier that Bowser has “said very little” since he was arrested.“I don’t know that he is in a state right now where he can be cooperative or uncooperative,” she said.“I just know that he does lapse into periods where he just sits there quietly, or wants to lay down, or doesn’t want to speak.”The father of Zina Bowser’s 3-year-old grandson said he knew when he heard what had happened that Erbie Bowser was behind it.“Once they started to get their divorce, he started acting crazy and talking about how he was going to kill everybody,” said Jamaree Johnson. “He just didn’t want to get divorced. He married a woman with some money and he quit his job right after they got married. She was taking care of him, and she finally got tired of taking care of him.”The mother of his child, Neima, feared the whole family was in danger.“That was her worst fear, and it came to reality,” he said.<em>Staff writers Tasha Tsiaperas, Tristan Hallman, Ed Timms and Liz Farmer contributed to this report.</em><small>©2018, The Dallas Morning News Inc.

505,491729,"  Officers were called to 2nd Street near North Franklin Street around 10 p.m. Sunday and found one person shot in the street and three more in a nearby home.  	 Cpl. Jamaine Crawford says a 16-year-old girl, a 17-year-old girl, a 20-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man were shot.   All of the victims were transported to Christina Hospital by ambulance and are listed in stable condition.   Crawford says officers called to the area earlier arrested two people on disorderly conduct charges.    After the report of the shootings, he says people crowded around the scene and officers made another arrest, but he did not have details on suspects in the shooting.   ""We're early in our investigation. We're going with the leads that are coming in and we are still working on it,"" Crawford said.   On Monday, neighbors said that what occurred the night before had been building for hours.  ""It was multiple fights, a lot of arguing with teenagers around here.  It started around 2nd Street and escalated to 3rd Street.  Cops got called out a couple of times,"" said Carmen Pacheco.  ""There were two or three fights, the same kids kept going back and forth, fighting back and forth and I could see it was escalating,"" said Luis Diaz.  The neighbors said police would respond, the kids would leave and so would police.  But, once the officers were gone, the problems would resume.  ""The fourth time came the shooting,"" said Pacheco.  What actually sparked the shooting is still under investigation.  Several elected officials, including the mayor, were on scene Sunday night.  Residents could be seen giving those officials an earful, pointing to a nearby surveillance camera.  On Monday, some residents said they want more police on routine patrol, even officers walking a beat.  ""I got five kids and I'm scared to bring them out here.  Really scared,"" Diaz said.    New Castle Council President Chris Bullock was among those on the scene Sunday night and heard the request for more boots on the ground.  ""That is the basic sentiment throughout the city is that people want stronger police presence in hot spots where crime is trending,"" Bullock said.

517,491819," Three stylists from the Bad Boyz Hair & Barber Salon were shot in front of their business along with another person who just happened to be on the sidewalk.   ""They were just lying there in pools of blood, just doing my best to hold his wounds,"" Oakland business woman Nenna Joiner said.  The trouble began a little after 4:00 p.m. when somebody broke into a car on Telegraph Avenue and grabbed a purse. It belonged to a man's girlfriend who is a stylist in the salon.   ""So I chased him down, up 18th Street and I caught him, got the purse back. Him and his friend or whatever, they ran away,"" he said.  Witnesses say at least one of them returned to the hair salon on a bike and with a gun. One man saw what happened while he was in a café across the street.  ""You hear a pop, pop. I walk out. I see the gentleman shooting Marquis when he's on the ground and I go over and render first aid,"" he said.  ""Before I could get back I hear a bunch of sirens and then when I hit the corner I see people laying on the ground and they were shot and I found out my girl was shot. I mean, all of this over a broken window and a few meaningless possessions. I mean, it's pointless,"" said the boyfriend of one of the victims.  Police are checking several surveillance cameras on Telegraph Avenue near 17th and 18th streets, hoping it will lead to the gunman.  Even though police say violent crime in this section of Oakland is relatively rare, some neighbors are not surprised.  ""Well it's not shocking. I mean one of the things the community has really called for is more presence with the police,"" Joiner said.  Police say the victims are expected to survive.  "

			Trending:		OAKLAND — A 20-year-old Oakland man has been arrested and charged in the Saturday afternoon shooting of four people outside an Uptown District hair salon after his attempt to steal a purse from a hair stylist’s car was foiled, police said Monday.Demetrius Ward was arrested about 11:39 p.m. Sunday in West Oakland. Police say Ward fired into the Badd Boyz Hair and Barber Salon in the 1700 block of Telegraph Avenue just after 4 p.m.The four were shot Saturday afternoon moments after the car of a 28-year-old stylist at the salon was broken into and her purse and other valuables taken. The woman’s boyfriend and some others chased Ward down and got back her purse, but Ward got away, authorities said.Police said Ward soon returned on a bicycle with a gun about 4:10 p.m. and began firing into the salon.Of the four wounded, three worked at the salon, including one man who was shot four times. All four have been released from the hospital and are expected to survive.Ward was charged with one count of attempted murder, three counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm, second-degree automobile burglary and violation of probation. Ward has a prior conviction for residential burglary in June 2012. Ward only admitted to the auto burglary, police said.  Ward will be prosecuted as a two-strike felon and could face a maximum 25 years to life in prison. He is being held without bail.“He’s one of the people that really need to be kept behind bars for good,” said Dwayne McCarther, a part owner of the hair salon. “This is some kind of new generation that is absolutely heartless.”McCarther said his employees, including Patrick Fair, were trying to protect their female co-worker. Fair, who was shot in the calf, returned to the hair salon Monday and plans to go back to work as soon as possible.“These guys are heroes,” McCarther said. “They were trying to defend a lady and her property.” Investigating Officer Anwawn Jones credited patrol officers with getting Ward into custody. Using surveillance photos of Ward, the officers spotted him in the 2100 block of Market Street. Burglary tools, including lockpicks, were found on Ward while he was being taken into custody, police said. The arrest also was due to cooperation from victims, who helped identify the shooter, Oakland Interim Chief Sean Whent said Monday. Police said at least one victim of the shooting identified Ward as the gunman.Historically, police have had trouble getting witnesses and victims of violent crime in Oakland to cooperate, making arrests difficult.Staff writer Natalie Alund contributed to this report.

Alex and Susan Craig talk about a shooting that occurred over the weekend on Scottwood Avenue in Toledo's Old West End. They are unsettled by the shooting, but they will not move after 46 years there.
There was one shot — pop — and everyone dropped to the floor.Jamil Bolden fell on top of a group of women, trying to protect them from any more gunfire.One young woman near him had a bloody cheek — she must have been hit, he reasoned.It wasn't until he got home, and his girlfriend saw blood on his shirt, that Mr. Bolden, 18, realized he also was shot.The teen was one of four people shot Saturday night at the “Mansion Party,” as it was promoted on social media, in Toledo's Old West End neighborhood. An estimated 200 people were at the party in a red-brick, corner-lot mansion at 2272 Scottwood Ave.The music was loud, the girls were pretty, and initially, the atmosphere was fun.About an hour into the party, at 10:26 p.m., Rebecca Boone called the Toledo police nonemergency phone line to report an underage-drinking party at the house.“The house was full,” said Ms. Boone, a 10-year Old West End resident. “There were kids everywhere. We know the neighborhood, and we know that's not right.”At 10:51 p.m., another caller made a noise complaint. About 20 minutes later, more calls — now for a fight.“Everything started around 11, it started getting rowdy,” said Mr. Bolden, who was treated at Toledo Hospital for a graze wound to the left side of his abdomen. “You could feel the tension. You could feel in the atmosphere something was going to happen. Before we could leave, that's when everything started going crazy.”Mr. Bolden said a group of people got into a fight and ran outside, possibly to retrieve guns.About this time, a security officer from Signal 88, a private security company that patrols the Old West End, was at the scene, waiting for police to arrive.At 11:16 p.m., “shots-fired” calls started coming in to Toledo police.“My officer actually heard the shots, and that's when he heard a bunch of people screaming, and they all started to pour into the street,” said Ian Scherer, a Signal 88 shift supervisor. “He pointed women who were screaming for help toward his vehicle for cover.”Two minutes later, at 11:18, police were dispatched. The first crews arrived four minutes later.“I look out the window and it looked like a swarm of kids,” said neighbor Susan Craig, who has lived in her home, with her husband Alex, for 46 years. “Kids were running left and right, helter-skelter.”As people were leaving the party, piling into cars, more shots were fired.Mr. Scherer, who showed up at the Scottwood home after the shooting, said people in cars were shooting at other people in cars, continuing to fire as they sped off.A total of four people, including Mr. Bolden, were wounded in the shooting. Treated for “minor injuries” were Ronald Smith, 22, Taylor McCormick, 19, and Sidresha Lamb, 17, all of Toledo.“I'll call it hell,” Mr. Bolden said. ""A bullet ain't got no name. They'll come at anybody.”Ms. Boone and other Old West End residents, who sounded off on social media, said police should have responded sooner.“I definitely think they dropped the ball,” Ms. Boone said. “They just didn't take action quick enough. I know we're short on cops … but they already knew it was a problem house.”Police Sgt. Joe Heffernan said that, on busy nights — like weekends, when 911-call volume often increases — “we have to prioritize our calls by level of importance.”“The initial call … had not been dispatched because of higher priority calls,” the sergeant said.About three weeks earlier, police and Signal 88 were sent to the house to break up another party, Mr. Scherer said.The Scottwood house's wrap-around porch was littered Monday afternoon with broken glass. A tipped-over city garbage can lay on the ground with at least one empty liquor bottle inside. A man who answered the door declined to comment.“To have something of this nature happen here is unsettling,” said Mr. Craig. “But we're not about to move.”<em>Contact Taylor Dungjen at <a href=""mailto:tdungjen@theblade.com"" target=""_blank"">tdungjen@theblade.com</a>, or 419-724-6054, or on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/taylordungjen"" target=""_blank"">@taylordungjen</a>.</em>

Wadesboro police officers later spotted the vehicle and attempted to stop it.“The condition of the other four shooting victims is unknown but not believed to be life threatening,” Sheriff Allen said Monday morning.Two of the other four victims are juveniles; one 15 and one 17. The seventeen year old was shot “through and through the forearm,” said Scott. He has been released from the hospital and was able to return to school in Lancaster County last week. The other juvenile is out of the hospital and has returned to school as well. However, a bullet remains lodged in his back, near the spine.The other two victims, both shot in the forehead, remain in critical condition.

528,491965,"<em>Updated 08/20/13 – 4:56 p.m.</em><strong>(CBS)</strong>Police and several ambulances converged at Wilson Avenue and Sheridan Road Monday evening, following the shooting, which occurred shortly before 6 p.m. near a bus stop in front of the Uptown Baptist Church.According to 46th Ward Alderman James Cappelman, police have three persons of interest in custody and have recovered video footage from a nearby police camera and cameras from nearby businesses. However, Police News Affairs Officer Daniel O’Brien denied that anyone was in custody, adding there is “misinformation out there.”Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy earlier said investigators believe, from shell casings found at the scene, that an assault weapon was used in the attack.“It’s ironic how things kind of come together. You’ve heard me talk about assault weapons. It looks like there was an assault weapon used in that shooting last night,” said McCarthy.“These are not things that belong in an urban setting. There’s no reason for them in a free society. That’s a military-grade weapon that was created to kill people during combat.That corner is located along the “Safe Passage” route for students attending Joseph Brennemann Elementary School, which is receiving students who attended Graeme Stewart Elementary School, which was one of 49 elementary schools shut down by the Chicago Public Schools this summer. Stewart Elementary is around the corner from the shooting, on Kenmore Avenue, just south of Wilson.Police sources said three of the victims are gang members. Two were innocent bystanders. Police sources said three different gangs in the area have been fighting for territory.Uptown Baptist Church Pastor Michael Allen said he heard the shooting was the result of one gang placing a hit on a rival gang member.“He happened to be standing where a group of others were standing, and so folks were caught in the melee,” Allen said. “That’s just tragic.”All the victims of the shooting were men, their ages ranging from 21 to 58. The youngest victim was shot in the head.The victims’ conditions ranged from extremely critical to critical to good, the Chicago Fire Department said in a Twitter posting. Police initially said one person died in the shooting, but later said that victim was in extremely critical condition at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center.Witnesses said a white 4-door car pulled up in front of the church, and someone inside opened fire.“I heard what I thought was fireworks,” said Joe Rogers, who was working security at the Uptown Shop and Save at the corner of Wilson and Sheridan when he heard the gun shots. Allen said the church was hosting a prayer service at the time, and giving out meals to more than 100 homeless people.“We heard the barrage of shots outside. There must have been at least 15 to 20 shots fired, and then after that, I went out to find out what was going on, and just saw carnage at the base of the church steps,” he said.Allen said pools of blood and the wounded victims lay just outside the church doors after the shooting.“I do believe at least two or three of the victims had either just come into the sanctuary, or to our meal, or were just leaving the Monday night meal,” Allen said.Rogers said there was blood everywhere. He saw a white car speeding away from the scene. “I see three people down on the ground; one on his back, one on his side, and one is face down,” said Rogers. With his church sitting along the border between two or three gangs, Allen said he’s committed to the community.“This kind of stuff doesn’t scare us off. We’re just going to redouble our efforts to love on the community, and show the love of God to people,” he said.No one was in custody for the shooting as of Tuesday morning. Police were reviewing video from a blue light surveillance camera near the scene.It was the second time in little more than a week that there was a shooting along a designated “Safe Passage” route for a public school. However, neither shooting happened during school hours, when the program’s volunteers, paid “Safe Passage” workers, police officers, and other city employees will be manning the routes to keep kids safe going to and from school.<br/>Mayor Rahm Emanuel said, starting Monday, there 600 newly trained Safe Passage workers, and hundreds more volunteers keeping watch over the routes, including at Sheridan and Wilson.“It is our obligation, not just because we work for the taxpayers – although we have a primary – it’s the obligation of every adult to make sure a child is protected. Whether you’re employed, or a city employee, or not,” he said.Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett noted there’s much more to the Safe Passage routes than simply placing yellow signs designating certain streets as part of the program.“Safe Passage is not just the geographic passage where children walk, it’s a comprehensive strategy … involving multiple resources of the sister agencies,” she said.In addition to having police officers and firefighters helping keep an eye on the Safe Passage routes, the city’s Buildings Department has secured or demolished 300 abandoned buildings on or near the routes; animal control workers will be on the lookout for dangerous dogs along the paths; Streets and Sanitation Department employees have been cleaning up vacant lots; and Park District workers will provide security at public parks along the routes.Altogether, representatives from 16 city agencies will play a role in the program once classes begin on Aug. 26. The other shooting on a Safe Passage route happened in Bronzeville on Aug. 11, when one man was killed and another was wounded in the 2900 block of South State Street."
529,491965,"People were gathered on the steps of the Uptown Baptist Church for prayer and a free meal Monday evening when a white sedan pulled up and someone inside sprayed the street with a high-powered rifle.Five men went down as the car made a U-turn on Wilson Avenue and sped off, leaving a trail of nearly two dozen shell casings. Inside the church, speakers thought the shots were firecrackers and services continued for several more minutes.""It was a constant bang, bang, bang,"" said Joseph Rogers, a security guard at the nearby Uptown Shop & Save at Wilson and Sheridan Road.He rushed outside to see the white car fleeing west on Wilson and one wounded man on the church steps and three others on the street. ""There was blood everywhere,"" Rogers said.Police say five men between the ages of 21 and 58 were shot. The youngest victim was shot in the head and was in critical condition at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, authorities said. Police initially said the man had died.Three other victims were brought to Weiss Memorial Hospital: a 44-year-old man shot in the knee, a 58-year-old man shot in the hand and a 32-year-old man shot in the ankle. All were in good condition, police said. A 26-year-old man was shot in both arms and was reported stable at Illinois Masonic.Police say the shooting was sparked by a conflict between two gangs in that section of Uptown, and patrols have been watching for any retaliation. The shooting occurred along a Safe Passage route mapped by The route has been laid out for children who are transfering to Brenneman Elementary this year from Stewart Elementary, one of dozens of schools closed by CPS.A hearing officer, retired Cook County Judge Charles Winkler, had opposed the closing of Stewart, saying school officials and police could not guarantee the safety of school children who will now have to walk farther to school.“Is there really enough time to get everyone up to speed so the 14,400 children from the closing schools are provided safe passage,” Winkler wrote. ""Will an understaffed Chicago Police Department be able to provide enough officers to assist the Stewart children? Will CPS hire a private security company to furnish properly trained personnel?""Mayor Rahm Emanuel acknowledged today that the shooting was ""an early warning sign to all of us to be more on our toes than we were already on our toes."" Monday's shooting occurred shortly before 6 p.m. as the church was holding a prayer service where meals are offered to the homeless. Monday was taco night. Eric Ray said he heard the shooting from the front pews. He said he frequents the neighborhood but avoids lingering at Wilson and Sheridan.""I normally don't hang out on that corner,"" he said. ""It's a bad corner.""Mike Gillhouse, 25, said he moved to Uptown from Wheaton last year and didn't know that shootings erupt in the neighborhood from time to time. Now, he wants to move further south into Lincoln Park or any other neighborhood that is safer.""I guess I was naive. I figured after college ... I'd move to the city and try to find a job out here,"" he said just outside the red police tape cordoning off the intersection of Wilson and Sheridan. ""Just, you know, move away from the suburban bubble so to speak. And I kind of regret that decision now.""He said he was getting off the CTA Red Line train at Argyle Avenue a few blocks away when he saw the ""blue lights"" at Wilson and Sheridan. Gillhouse said there's been warning signs about the neighborhood ever since he moved there last September.""Just disreputable-looking folk roaming around, you know, (the train) station. Stuff like that,"" he said.He said he commutes to the suburbs for work but still wanted to see what city living was all about. ""I grew up in the suburbs,"" he said.

532,491992,"An infant child was found next to her dying mother just before dawn Tuesday after police say a man broke into a Pigtown home, killed a young couple and shot two others — a grisly scene that brought to 20 the number of people shot in the city in a span of 80 hours.Police said they had charged 35-year-old Melville Mason, who they said was caught trying to escape the home. The arrest came as officials sought to address concerns about spiking crime amid a violent summer and a recent outburst of street robberies throughout the city.""The biggest fear is the threat of retaliation, and that's what we need to get in front of,"" Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said at an afternoon news conference at police headquarters.Officials said they would pull officers from administrative roles to bolster patrol ranks, and announced arrests in other cases — including a fatal stabbing of a teen after the Murders and non-fatal shootings both remain higher than at this time last year by double-digit percentages, and the city is in danger of reversing six consecutive years of declines in non-fatal shootings.In the Pigtown shooting, sources with knowledge of the case said police believe Mason may have been involved in a dispute with one of the victims days earlier, broke in and opened fire. He then left, retrieved another gun and returned, according to the sources.Baltimore City Council Vice President Edward Reisinger, who represents the Pigtown neighborhood where Tuesday's shooting occurred, said he's been told by police that many of the recent shootings stem from drug disputes.""When you see a spike — especially if it's shootings and homicides — even if it's drug-related, the people who live in that neighborhood, the families, the kids, the grandmothers, they don't know what's going to happen,"" he said.Women and children have been caught up in the violent spate. In addition to Tuesday's shooting of three women, a woman was shot in the leg Monday night in Perkins Homes housing project in Southeast Baltimore and a 7-year-old boy was among three people shot Saturday night in Johnston Square.""We've had a rough couple of weeks,"" said Jerry Rodriguez, another deputy commissioner.He said police would be out in force ""to reassure that we, as your Police Department, are doing everything we can to … guarantee your safety."" The commanders said citizen tips have helped police close cases, but they would need more help.""We want you to understand we can only do so much,"" he said. ""We're asking the community to please share in our frustration and share in our anger and provide us with information.""Mayor ""I have confidence that police are taking steps to get violent offenders off the street,"" she said.In Pigtown, about 30 residents stood on sidewalks or porches Tuesday, watching police officers, homicide detectives and crime scene technicians go into and out of the two-story rowhouse in the 1200 block of S. Carey St.""It's so peaceful around here, there's no crime,"" said neighbor Margit Clokey. ""This is a shocker. It's so close to home.""About 5:47 a.m., officers arriving on the block said, they saw Mason crawling out of a rowhouse window.Police, who said they recovered at least one weapon, took him into custody, entered the house and found Meghan Kerrigan, 22, and William Monroe, 21, fatally shot. Neighbors say Kerrigan and Monroe were the parents of the infant, who was unharmed inside. Police said they turned the child over to relatives.Two women believed to be in their 40s were also found and taken to area hospitals. One was listed in critical condition Tuesday and one was in stable condition. Neighbors say one of them is Monroe's mother, who has lived in the rowhouse for more than two decades.Neighbors say the family worked in the scrap metal and recycling business, while Monroe also worked as a roofer. They were well liked and kept to themselves, caring for their child, Clokey said.Mason, neighbors said, lived just a few houses away at the corner of South Carey and Carroll streets in a basement apartment. He has prior addresses in Sykesville, court records show.Evelyn Lawson, Mason's grandmother, said he is a churchgoing, married man and a good father to his 1-year-old daughter. She said she could not believe the allegations.""This is all news to me about what happened,"" she said. ""His family all loves him. We all love him. This is a terrible tragedy.""Police have not released specifics of the charges, and Mason does not have a lawyer listed in online court records on these allegations. Online court records show multiple arrests and assault and drug convictions.Several residents knew Mason as ""P.J.,"" and said he often parked his four vehicles — two Trans Ams, a Subaru Outback and a blue pickup truck — on the street next to his house, taking up every nearby space.Henry Ott, 67, lived next door and said he often argued with Mason. The two had feuded because Ott kept watch of Mason's comings and goings.""He tried to rule the neighborhood and tell the people how to live,"" Ott said.Melissa Borck, who grew up in the neighborhood, said Mason could be standoffish. His treasured cars were ""all he talked about,"" she said.She said she was headed to the store at about 5 a.m. on Tuesday when she saw Mason sitting in one of his black sports cars across from his home. He motioned for her to come over, Brock said, but she refused.""Happened right after that,"" she said. ""I'm shocked. Maybe I'll cry later when I see it [on the news]. I'm still shocked.""As detectives overheard neighbors talk openly about Mason, police cordoned off his home and knocked on the door. No one answered, and police soon summoned a red tow truck with flames on the hood to tow away one of Mason's cars parked on Carroll Street.In addition to Mason's arrest, police said they had charged a 16-year-old, Nazir Williams, in a fatal stabbing that occurred downtown after the <em>Baltimore Sun reporter Kevin Rector contributed to this article.</em><em><a href=""mailto:jgeorge@baltsun.com"">jgeorge@baltsun.com</a></em><em>twitter.com/justingeorge</em>"
533,491992,"A Baltimore man received two consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to murdering a young couple in Pigtown, wounding two others and leaving an infant child among the carnage.Melville Mason, 37, pleaded guilty Monday for the shooting Aug. 20, 2013, that left William Monroe, 21, and Meghan Kerrigan, 22, dead. Police said at the time that Kerrigan's 1-year-old daughter was found sitting next to her mother, patting her body.The motive for the killing was said to be a dispute over $10, and Mason reportedly said, ""I am the Reaper"" and ""This is your worst nightmare,"" after kicking in the door, witnesses said.Monroe's mother, Rhonda, attended the sentencing hearing with pictures of the couple's daughter, and wearing a T-shirt with Monroe's and Kerrigan's pictures. Rhonda Monroe was one of the two women wounded in the attack, and she said the bullet is still lodged in her arm.""I still hear my son screaming, the gunshots,"" she said after the plea hearing. ""It's terrible.""Brandon Kerrigan said his sister was an ""incredible mother"" who was hoping to go back to school to work with pets. ""I just can't understand how anyone could do that to her,"" he said of the shooting.The couple's daughter has been adopted by Monroe's brother, who moved from Baltimore ""to get her away from all this,"" Brandon Kerrigan said.Witnesses told police that Mason, known as ""P.J.,"" broke into the home through a first-floor window propped open with a window fan and began firing a 9 mm handgun. Mason then allegedly left the home, obtained a new handgun, and returned through the same window and began firing again.Kerrigan was on the phone with 911 operators when she was killed, prosecutors said.""It took me three days to get over [the final moments of the tape],"" Assistant State's Attorney Beth Durand said in a news release from the state's attorney's office. ""Every time I closed my eyes the only thing I could hear was their screams.""At the plea hearing, Mason apologized to the family but claimed that Monroe had threatened him with a gun days earlier.The shooting occurred during a violent weekend in Baltimore that saw 20 people shot over a span of 80 hours.<em><a href=""mailto:jfenton@baltsun.com"">jfenton@baltsun.com</a></em>"

The shooter, Hubert Allen Jr., 72, is the step-grandfather of Buffalo Bills running back C.J. Spiller. He also worked hand-in-hand with people in the community and never showed signs of such a violent act.""To tell you the honest truth. I never seen an angry bone in his body. Something must have just made him went off on him. We're looking at that and trying to figure out why,"" Union County Sheriff Jerry Whitehead said. Whitehead is victim Marvin Pritchett's nephew.Allen drove to several locations around Union County Saturday, including the headquarters for Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot the men Saturday, according to a Union County Sheriff's Office news release. It added that authorities believe Allen acted alone.Authorities said Allen shot and killed former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28, around 9 a.m. Saturday, then went a short distance and fatally shot his former employer, 80-year-old Marvin Pritchett.A few minutes later, he pulled over where another former co-worker was driving a farm tractor, exchanged words with him and then fired one shot from a shotgun, authorities said. That victim, 66-year-old Lewis Mabrey Jr., was in good condition as he was preparing to undergo surgery for a broken arm and other injuries, according to officials.Not long after that, Allen went to the company's headquarters in Lake Butler and shot 44-year-old David Griffis in the stomach, the release said. Griffis was in critical condition. Authorities said Allen then returned to his nearby home and killed himself.With a population of about 2,000, Lake Butler is located about an hour's drive southwest of Jacksonville. Authorities said he was a longtime employee of the trucking company.Investigators were working at the five shooting scenes and interviewing witnesses and company employees. The sheriff's statement said they were working to determine a motive. The sheriff's office also called in investigators from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to help with the various shooting scenes.The trucking company's website said it employs 400 people and owns hundreds of vehicles that operate around the country. It said Pritchett started the trucking company in 1980.""Our thoughts and prayers are with all of their families, and at this time our sole focus is on those impacted by today's events. Words cannot express the pain and sorrow felt by so many yet we are comforted by the memories of those lost,"" the company said in a statement.The company's chief financial officer, Steve Perez, didn't respond to an email seeking further comment.

Wainwright, 32, of the 9200 block of East 6th Avenue, and Da’Vaughn Pitts, 18, of the 300 block of North Lake Street.Wainwright died from a single gunshot and Pitts died from multiple gunshot wounds, the coroner’s office reported.Wainwright was pronounced dead at 5 at the scene. Pitts was pronounced dead at 5:30 p.m. at the Methodist Hospitals Northlake Campus in Gary.Four others were shot in the incident, including a Portage woman and a Gary woman. The other two gunshot victims are Gary men.One of the wounded men is in critical condition, Ingram said.Two women in their 20s were also shot, but their conditions are not considered life-threatening, the chief said.<a href=""http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary/gary-shootout-leaves-dead-several-wounded/article_c98c26ea-56f8-56bb-813d-5d5628587070.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary/gary-shootout-leaves-dead-several-wounded/article_c98c26ea-56f8-56bb-813d-5d5628587070.html</a><a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-2-dead-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting-20130907-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-2-dead-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting-20130907-story.html</a><a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-07/news/chi-2-dead-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting-20130907_1_gary-shooting-early-morning-shooting-northlake-campus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-07/news/chi-2-dead-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting-20130907_1_gary-shooting-early-morning-shooting-northlake-campus</a><a href=""http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/09/08/Two-dead-four-wounded-in-Gary-Ind-shooting/93281378615026/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/09/08/Two-dead-four-wounded-in-Gary-Ind-shooting/93281378615026/</a><a href=""http://wgntv.com/2013/09/07/2-dead-4-injured-in-gary-shooting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wgntv.com/2013/09/07/2-dead-4-injured-in-gary-shooting/</a><a href=""https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1nVF0eJu7MTmYnP2BQwtXswlOKO31996FFtdmKc4#rows:id=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1nVF0eJu7MTmYnP2BQwtXswlOKO31996FFtdmKc4#rows:id=1</a><a href=""http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary/article_c98c26ea-56f8-56bb-813d-5d5628587070.html#.Ui32_mPwe1E.twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary/article_c98c26ea-56f8-56bb-813d-5d5628587070.html#.Ui32_mPwe1E.twitter</a><a href=""http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/09/07/2-killed-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/09/07/2-killed-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting/</a>Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:

It appears he was shooting low,” Spratt said.The weapon was a 40-caliber semi-automatic, according to Spratt.Four victims were transported to the hospital, one to Mission Trauma Center with what was thought to be serious injuries, and three to McDowell with non-life threatening injuries, according to a press release from the McDowell County EMS.All patients had been released as of Saturday.There are leads on the suspect, but as of Saturday afternoon no one was in custody.Names of the suspect and victims have not been released.Vic Douglas, a cook at Vortex, called 911 after the bartender ran in and said shots were being fired. Douglas said there were about 30 people at Vortex last night.“We have been quiet for so long. We haven’t had any trouble,” said Douglas.The Marion Police Department, the McDowell County Sheriff’s Office, and the McDowell County EMS responded and assisted at the crime scene."

We (Vortex) had a birthday/ family reunion party Friday night with a family that I have had a good working relationship in the past, and we agreed to do concessions for their event. I had no reason to think there would be trouble. There was a family related scuffle inside that was over 15 minutes prior to the shooting that took place outside. No one inside was aware of the shooting, until people started exiting slowly. It really had nothing to do with us (Vortex).

Jake Smith says the caller told authorities a man was chasing a woman outside while shooting at her. Officials say 34-year-old Angelina Benton, 19-year-old Raynord Daniel and 12-year-old Joseph McDonald were killed. Smith says the woman's 23-year-old boyfriend was also shot in his leg and is expected to recover.Smith says the suspect has been identified as 33-year-old Robert Bell. Officials say Benton allowed Bell and his wife to move into her home about two weeks ago, and the motive behind the shooting is unclear.

Bell was booked into jail in New Orleans, La., at about 2:30 p.m. local time Thursday. Gwinnett County police said the 34-year-old, a suspect in the Sept. 15 triple homicide on Anderson Livsey Lane, had been tracked down by the U.S. Marshall’s Service and the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office’s fugitive unit, who “developed intelligence on a possible location for Bell in New Orleans.”“The local fugitive task force in New Orleans checked the location, a homeless shelter, and located Bell,” police spokesman Cpl. Jake Smith said. “He led law enforcement officials on a brief foot chase before being taken into custody.”No further information about the arrest was available Thursday. Gwinnett County detectives will travel to New Orleans to follow up, Smith said.Authorities believe Angela Benton had taken Bell and his wife into her home when they hit hard times. But as Benton, her 12-year-old son, 19-year-old godson and 23-year-old boyfriend arrived home from out of town on the evening of Sept. 15, Bell was allegedly waiting inside with a semi-automatic rifle.All but the boyfriend, Justin Cato, were shot and killed. Bell reportedly fled on foot — Benton, who was driving Bell’s SUV, still had his keys — and hadn’t been seen since.After Gwinnett County police initially hypothesized their suspect could be in south Georgia, Tennessee, or Chicago, a pickup truck stolen half a mile from the Sept. 15 murder scene was recovered earlier this month near New Orleans.Bell will eventually be extradited to Gwinnett to face charges including murder and aggravated assault.

Yakima police said Monday that their search for suspects in the weekend shooting of six people is stymied by a lack of cooperation from victims.Police are using footage collected by security cameras at Aladdin's Hookah Lounge to piece together what happened, but little information has come forward from the victims, who were shot in the parking lot of the business about 2:30 a.m. Sunday.""With relative certainty, among these victims, somebody knows that car or who was in that car, but they're not sharing that with us,"" Yakima Police Capt. Rod Light said Monday morning. ""That makes it very, very difficult.Five of the six people shot were treated and released from Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital on Sunday. Their ages ranged from 20 to 27.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.But 31-year-old Anthony D. Bradley is now at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center being treated for two gunshot wounds to the back. He underwent two surgeries Sunday and a third Monday, but remains in critical condition, Light said.Light couldn't confirm whether any of the victims are gang members, but said some had a documented past of gang affiliations. Comments by victims and witnesses in the immediate aftermath of the shooting lead police to believe the shooting is gang-related, Light said.""We're certainly concerned about retaliatory shootings,"" Light said. ""We're working to put together intel that would provide us information to short-circuit something like that from happening.""So far police have only confirmed that the vehicle involved in the shooting was a small, dark-colored sedan, Light said. Police are also following up on rumors that the shooting may have stemmed from an incident at another establishment earlier Saturday night.On Monday, Yakima police Chief Dominic Rizzi said he has heard little public outcry as a result of the incident, but that incidents such as what happened Sunday can't go unresolved.""There should be public outcry,"" Rizzi said. ""It's something that should not happen.""

Mayor Vincent Gray reported late Monday eight individuals were injured, including a D.C. police officer, identified as Scott Williams, who was shot in the leg while responding to the shooting. After being in surgery for hours, doctors say they hope he will be able to walk again.None of the fatalities is reported to be military personnel. The rest of the injured individuals suffered non-life threatening injuries and are expected to recover.<a href=""http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Police-Search-Alleged-Gunmans-Hotel-Room-224000181.html"">Also Monday night,</a>Alexis allegedly opened fire just before 8:30 a.m. Monday along the third and fourth floors of Building 197 of the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters in Southeast D.C. Bullets hit walls, and people around them fell to the floor, bleeding. Officials reported Alexis had ""legitimate access"" to enter the Navy Yard at the time as a civilian contractor, using a valid pass.Survivors of the morning attack recalled sprinting from the sound of gunfire on the third and fourth floors of Building 197 of the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters. Bullets hit walls, and people around them fell to the floor, bleeding.""I was in the cafeteria, just paid for my breakfast,"" Patricia Ward said. ""I was waiting for my friend to pay for hers when we heard the gunshot. It was three gunshots straight in a row, pop pop pop. Three seconds later, it was pop pop pop pop pop, so it was like about a total of seven gunshots, and we just started running.""When it was over, the suspected gunman lay dead amid an armload of weapons. Sources told News4 that surveillance footage showed that he began his attack with a shotgun, but was found with a 9mm pistol. Police confirmed that there was no AR-15 assault rifle used, as previously reported.NBC News correspondent Pete Williams is reporting Alexis purchased a shotgun in Lorton, Va. during the past week or so. <ul><li><a href=""http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Washington-DC-Gunman-From-Fort-Worth-NBC-News-223948451.html""><strong>READ MORE: D.C. Navy Yard Gunman Is Ex-Officer with Ft. Worth Ties <br/></strong></a></li></ul>The suspected gunman appeared to have seized firearms from two of his victims as he moved through the building along the Anacostia River in southeast Washington, where 3,000 Navy employees go to work each day, many of them carrying authorized firearms.Next to Alexis's body was an ID of a man who used to work at the Navy Yard. Some investigators believe the suspected gunman used that ID to enter the area, which is accessible only through guarded gates, but he may also have shot his way in, Williams reported.The pandemonium continued after the suspected gunman was killed, as authorities suspected that more than one gunman remained on the loose. Eight nearby schools were put on lockdown. And as of Monday evening, D.C.'s mayor still said investigators are examining whether there was another gunman at large.Terrie Durham, a civilian employee in the Office of Naval Sea Systems Command, was looking for a way out and glimpsed the gunman down a hallway, about 40 feet away. He was wearing blue, a uniform, maybe, and held a rifle. He said nothing. Then he fired.""He aimed high and missed,"" Durham said. ""I saw where the shot missed. It was a few feet ahead of us and a foot or above where we would have been standing.""She took off into a stairwell, hollering, ""There is a man shooting in the building, get out, get out!""<strong>Multiple weapons</strong>Survellance video shows the gunman entered the NAVSEA building, at 1336 Isaac Hull Ave., with a shotgun, law enforcement officials told News4's Jackie Bensen.The suspected gunman shot a security officer in the head, killing him, and took the officer's 9 mm pistol and a magazine of ammunition. The shooter then continued through the building and seemed to target  his victims, who were mostly on the third and fourth floors, Bensen reported.D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department and several other law  enforcement agencies responded with active shooter teams.During that response, a MPD  officer was shot in the leg. The gunman was then shot by a FBI hostage response team, law enforcement sources told Bensen.“The response by uniformed police officers from both the Metropolitan Police Department and United States Park Police was absolutely nothing short of heroic,” MPD Chief Cathy Lanier said.Authorities are investigating whether the gunman took the D.C. police officers' rifle.<ul><li><a href=""http://www.nbcwashington.com/video/#!/news/national-international/Raw-Video--Police-Respond-To-Shooting-at-Navy-Yard/223925571""><strong>WATCH: Raw Video: Police Respond to Shooting at Navy Yard</strong></a></li></ul>D.C. Police had said earlier Monday that they were seeking two other ""possible"" gunmen. Investigators later ruled one of them out as a suspect by watching video that tracked the man through the building and realizing that no harm resulted from his movements.Williams noted that many people are authorized to carry firearms at Navy  Yard.However, at an afternoon press conference, Mayor Vincent Gray said police were still working to rule out another suspect. Police released a lookout for a ""possible"" second shooter, described as a man between 40 and 50 years old, who was wearing olive drab and was armed with a ""long gun."" He was about 5-feet-10-inches tall and 180 pounds, African-American, with a medium complexion and graying sideburns.That lookout was canceled late Monday evening and D.C. Police said they felt comfortable they had the ""single and sole person responsible.""The motive is unknown, Gray said, though there were reports that Alexis may have had a grudge against the Navy. Gray said while there is no reason to suspect terrorism, it can't be ruled out yet.The FBI now is leading the investigation into what is the deadliest single incident within D.C. borders since 1982, when Air Florida Flight 90 crashed, killing 78 people.<strong>Obama: 'They're patriots'</strong>“We do know that several people have been shot, and some have been killed,” President Obama said from the White House Monday. “So we are confronting yet another mass shooting, and today it happened on a military installation in our nation’s capital. It’s a shooting that targeted military and civilian personnel.""These are men and women going to work, doing their job protecting all of us,"" Obama said. They’re patriots, and they know the dangers of serving abroad, but today they faced the unimaginable violence that they wouldn’t have expected here at home.""NAVSEA is the largest of the Navy's five system commands.

The other woman who works for the Navy did not require surgery. The gunshot to her head did not penetrate the skull.""There's something evil in our society that we as Americans have to work to try and eradicate,"" Orlowski said. ""I have to say, I may see this everyday, I may be the chief medical officer of a very large trauma center, but there's something wrong when we have these multiple shootings, these multiple injuries. There's something wrong.

567,480366,"Thirteen people are dead and at least eight others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, officials said, spreading fear and chaos across the region as authorities sought to contain the panic.The incident, in which the death toll rose almost hourly, represents the single worst loss of life in the District since an airliner plunged into the Potomac River in 1982, killing 78.D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and Mayor Vincent C. Gray announced the mounting number of casualties in a series of news conferences. The suspected shooter, identified by the FBI as Aaron Alexis, 34, living in Fort Worth, is among the dead. Alexis was a military contractor, one official said.Hours after the rampage began it remained unclear whether the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, or if other shooters were involved. Lanier initially said authorities were looking for two more potential shooters dressed in military style clothing. Shortly after she announced a detailed description of two suspects, city officials said one had been located and cleared. And at a 10 p.m. news conference she said police were comfortable the shooting had been committed by one person.Police are asking anyone with information on the suspect to call 202-727-9099. Shootings at Navy YardLanier lifted the shelter in place order for the neighborhood around the Navy Yard that had been in place for much of the day.Gray said those killed by the shooter ranged in age from 46-73 years old. He said the families of seven of the victims had been notified. Those victims were identified as: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61.The families of the six other victims were in the process of being notified.Lanier said one of those killed was a District resident, but she did not identify the person.Gray said another eight people were injured in the attack. He said three people were shot, including Metropolitan Police Officer Scott Williams. Gray said the officer was doing well.The other five had either stress related injuries, and at least one was someone who fell.Vice Adm. Bill French earlier had said that the number of injured was 14. [Gray said no motive is known yet. He said there is no reason to believe it was an act of terrorism, though he added that he could not rule it out.As of 8:30 p.m. Monday, Navy officials said about 2,000 people remained on base, and that it could take another 3-4 hours before everyone was cleared to leave.The FBI was still interviewing every person leaving the base out of concern that a second suspect may still be at large, French said. And SWAT teams are still finding people hiding in places on the base, where some had remained hunkered down since the initial attack early Monday morning. One city officials said that shortly before 7 p.m., officers found an employee hiding in a locker, where the employee had been for nearly 11 hours.  Throughout the day, people had been warned to stay in their homes and offices on the Naval Base as the incident unfolded.Alexis was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, two law enforcement officials said. One said he also had a shotgun. One official said all the weapons have not been accounted for.The first, sketchy details about the suspect offered few hints about what may have gone wrong.[ Alexis grew up in Brooklyn with his mother, Cathleen, and father, Anthony Alexis, according to his aunt Helen Weeks. “We haven’t seen him for years,” Weeks said of her nephew in a telephone interview. “I know he was in the military. He served abroad. I think he was doing some kind of computer work.”Alexis spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist from May 2007 until he was discharged in January 2011, according to a summary of his personnel records released by Navy officials at the Pentagon.The officials said they were still researching whether Alexis had been employed as a defense contractor or a civilian employee of the Navy, and were uncertain if he was assigned to work at the Navy Yard.He achieved his final rank of Aviation Electrician’s Mate 3rd Class in December 2009. Officials said they did not immediately know the reasons for his discharge. The carnage began around 8 a.m. when the U.S. Navy said that three shots were fired at Building 197, headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command. About 3,000 people work in the building. As the noise that some thought sounded like construction work continued, the realization set in that a gunman was firing on them.Rick Mason, a program management analyst who is a civilian with the U.S. Navy, told the Associated Press that a gunman was shooting from a fourth floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the gunman was aiming at people in the building’s first floor cafeteria. Terry Durham said that as she and co-workers were evacuating, she saw a man down the hall raise a rifle and fire toward them, hitting a wall. “He didn’t say a word,” said her co-worker, Todd Brundage. One man who said he was at his desk on the second floor when the shooting began recalled hearing a loud noise “like someone dropping an old metal desk.” The man, who declined to give his name, said there was a pause, then several noises close together and he realized the danger: “There’s a shooter in the building. I started walking toward the door and I heard people running down the hall.”Employees described the chaos, as a fire alarm sounded and people shouted, “Where is he? Where is he?”Gregory Dade, a Navy contractor, said he and a co-worker locked themselves in a second floor office of Building 197 as soon as the shooting went on, in fits and stops. Dade, called it “terrifying.”He heard a woman scream, glass crashing and a series of gun shots. Then he heard shouting: “Get down! Get down! This is the police.”Finally, about 11 a.m., he and a co-worker made a break for it. At an exit, they noticed a trail of blood running to the next building.Tim Jirus, a Navy commander who works in Building 197, said that as he was evacuating the building he saw a co-worker who had been shot getting into a police car, and heard more shots fired from inside his workplace.A far worse sight lay just ahead. Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe, and talked briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. It caused him to spin around to look for the source of the noise. But when he turned back, he looked down and saw the man he had been conversing with lying on the ground, shot in the head.Uncertain where the shooter was, he ran.“I was just lucky,” he said. “The other person was shorter than me. There were two shots, he got that guy, he didn’t get me. At least two police officers were among those shot. Lanier said the D.C. officer worked in the K-9 unit and has been on the force 23 years. She said she has known and worked closely with him for ""many, many years."" ""He's got a stellar record,"" she said. ""He's got a pretty serious injury, but right now his family is here with him and he's in good spirits,"" Lanier added. ""He's just very grateful for all the other responders who helped get him out of that building and get the medical attention he needed."" The other was said to be a base officer. Earlier in the say officials at MedStar Washington Hospital Center said his chances for survival were good.Janis Orlowski, the chief medical officer at Washington Hospital Center, said three victims in all were brought to the center, all in critical condition but alert, responsive and able to talk with doctors. The victims were also able to speak briefly to law enforcement officers before undergoing surgery or treatment, she said.The other two victims at the hospital were female civilians, Orlowski said at a news conference. All are likely to survive.The impact of the incident rippled across town, forces schools, offices and homes into an enforced lockdown.Senate buildings on Capitol Hill went on lockdown at about 3 p.m., with no one allowed to enter or leave the building, though it was partially lifted toward the end of the day to allow staffers to go home.The Nationals, whose ballpark is near the Navy Yard, postponed a Monday night game. Instead, they will play a double header Tuesday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. Ten public and charter schools and a public school administration building in the District went on lockdown, and flights out of Reagan National Airport were briefly halted, causing delays even after they began departing again.Adm.

Greenert, the chief of Naval Operations, was evacuated from his residence at the Navy Yard complex shortly after the first report of shots fired, Navy officials said.Greenert, a four-star admiral and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was safely evacuated to the Pentagon along with his wife, Darleen, said Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a Navy spokesman.Police closed the 11th Street Bridge as well as M Street SE between Second and Fourth streets SE because of the shooting. Entrances to the Navy Yard Metro station remain open. As helicopters circled overhead and emergency vehicles continued to rush to the scene, crowds of onlookers gathered on sidewalks and at a construction site near the Navy Yard, but police pushed them back, yelling at them to keep a distance from the grounds. President Obama on Monday expressed sympathy for the victims of the shooting and said justice must be sought.“I’ve made it clear to my team that we want the investigation to be seamless, so that local and federal authorities are working together,” he said.As a long day drew to a close, weary and stunned Navy personnel filtered into Capitol Hill in their tan uniforms, blue camouflage fatigues and civilian clothes, many of them saying little, just wanting to get home after a day spent running or hiding, and then waiting.Tom Dick-Peddie, 46, was at work in another building in the Navy Yard and said they were on lockdown for about an hour and a half, then they were evacuated to another building. Shortly after 3 p.m. they were allowed to leave. Kate O’Neill of Arlington and Stephanie Cates-Harman of Columbia, who work in the office of the general counsel, said their office had been ordered to shelter in place until 2 p.m. While some people were very upset, and others were calm, and tried to contact relatives to assure them that they were okay. “Texts were going fast and furious,” O’Neill said. Under Secretary for the Navy, Juan Garcia, said Navy Yard would reopen tomorrow for essential personnel only. Most employees would be encouraged to telecommute. Garcia said it was unclear who the base would reopen in its entirety. Garcia said the Navy has set up a counseling line for anyone struggling to cope with Monday's attack. That number is 1-800-222-0364. Both Gray and Lanier said the streets around the Navy Yard would be opened by about 5:30 a.m. Tuesday."

County coroner’s records.Sanchez was working alone at a discount store about 8:50 p.m. when a man walked in, robbed the store and shot her multiple times, police said. The attacker then ran away.A customer found Sanchez and called for help, police said.Paramedics took Sanchez to a hospital where she was pronounced dead at 9:40 p.m., said Ed Winter, a coroner’s spokesman.Sanchez was a mother of five who had been married for 20 years. At a news conference one day after her death, her family tearfully pleaded for the public’s help in catching her killer.Her daughter, Gabriela Sanchez, 18, told reporters that her mother was constantly working, and always told her children to only worry about school and making a better life.“She always told us, don’t worry, I’m here,” Gabriela Sanchez said.A 31-year-old man who was taken into custody during a parole check last month was charged Friday with murder in the Sept. 17 shooting death of a mother of five children who worked at a South LA discount store so she could help pay for her daughter’s college education.Eric Atkinson, an inmate at the Los Angeles County Jail identified by authorities as a reputed gang member, was charged late Friday morning with capital murder in the death of 39-year-old Martha Sanchez.

The injury does not appear to be life threatening.Justin Bryan Harger, 32, of Bakersfield died at the scene after being shot.Also Jorge Ramirez, 34, of Bakersfield died after being shot.The following are the officers involved in the shooting: Daniel Brewer, eight-year veteran; Rick Wimbish, 22-year-veteran; Ryan Vaughan, four-year veteran; Jess Beagley, eight-year veteran; and Chad Garrett, three-year veteran.Both Harger, 32, and Ramirez, 34, died at the scene. Police said an officer suffered a gunshot wound to the head that did not appear to be life-threatening, and another officer suffered a minor injury unrelated to the gunfire.The Harger family is angry because they believe that the shooting of Harger was premeditated murder.Sheila Somers, Harger’s mother, said police showed up to her home just days before his death and said they would kill Justin when they found him.According to Somers police told her, “you would want to turn him in because if we find him we are shooting him and if we catch him we are going to kill him.”BAKERSFIELD, Calif. – The lawyer of the family representing Jorge Joel Ramirez, a man fatally shot by police, released a statement on behalf of the family today.The lawyer, Mark J. Geragos, Esq., said that the family is demanding an investigation be completed by the Bakersfield Police Department in the death of Ramirez.Here’s the letter in its entirety:We represent the family of Jorge Joel Ramirez, a 34 year old unarmed young man who was shot and killed on September 16th, by Bakersfield Police while working as an informant for the Bakersfield Police Department.Jorge was working with the Bakersfield police to catch a armed and dangerous fugitive wanted in a shooting. It is clear that something went terribly wrong, but the family has been stonewalled by the Bakersfield Police. Our own preliminary investigation has revealed extensive communications by the Bakersfield police directing Jorge.The Bakersfield police sent Jorge to his execution on September 16, 2013. The police also placed the entire community at risk based on their reckless and outrageous operation.The Police release of public information of the facts surrounding the shooting are a moving target. The goal seems to be an attempt to explain and justify the killing while slandering Jorge. Even while this so called investigation is still pending and Police Chief Williamson’s has indicated that he has already made up his mind and that he has decided his officers did nothing wrong.The family of Jorge demand an investigation conducted by an independent agency. Chief Williamson should insist on an independent investigation, at very least, to avoid the bias he has already injected into the process through his media appearances. He should immediately step aside from any involvement in this matter. The officers involved in the shooting, who have so far illegally refused to give statements, must be compelled to provide statements about their involvement and they must be held accountable for their conduct as required by the law.Ramirez was unarmed. He was apparently caught in a gunfight between several Bakersfield police officers and the fugitive he was ostensibly trying to help them apprehend, 32-year-old Justin Bryan Harger. Harger fired at police, striking Officer Daniel Brewer, who was hospitalized but released a few hours later.<a

shootout happened at 12:34 a.m. during a traffic stop in the east parking lot of the Four Points by Sheraton hotel on California Avenue, according to Sims.According to BPD Public Information Officer Michaela Sims, a police officer — whose identity has not been released — sustained a moderate gunshot wound to the head. The injury does not appear to be life threatening.Justin Bryan Harger, 32, of Bakersfield died at the scene after being shot.Also Jorge Ramirez, 34, of Bakersfield died after being shot.The following are the officers involved in the shooting: Daniel Brewer, eight-year veteran; Rick Wimbish, 22-year-veteran; Ryan Vaughan, four-year veteran; Jess Beagley, eight-year veteran; and Chad Garrett, three-year veteran.Both Harger, 32, and Ramirez, 34, died at the scene. Police said an officer suffered a gunshot wound to the head that did not appear to be life-threatening, and another officer suffered a minor injury unrelated to the gunfire.The Harger family is angry because they believe that the shooting of Harger was premeditated murder.Sheila Somers, Harger’s mother, said police showed up to her home just days before his death and said they would kill Justin when they found him.According to Somers police told her, “you would want to turn him in because if we find him we are shooting him and if we catch him we are going to kill him.”BAKERSFIELD, Calif. – The lawyer of the family representing Jorge Joel Ramirez, a man fatally shot by police, released a statement on behalf of the family today.The lawyer, Mark J. Geragos, Esq., said that the family is demanding an investigation be completed by the Bakersfield Police Department in the death of Ramirez.Here’s the letter in its entirety:We represent the family of Jorge Joel Ramirez, a 34 year old unarmed young man who was shot and killed on September 16th, by Bakersfield Police while working as an informant for the Bakersfield Police Department.Jorge was working with the Bakersfield police to catch a armed and dangerous fugitive wanted in a shooting. It is clear that something went terribly wrong, but the family has been stonewalled by the Bakersfield Police. Our own preliminary investigation has revealed extensive communications by the Bakersfield police directing Jorge.The Bakersfield police sent Jorge to his execution on September 16, 2013. The police also placed the entire community at risk based on their reckless and outrageous operation.The Police release of public information of the facts surrounding the shooting are a moving target. The goal seems to be an attempt to explain and justify the killing while slandering Jorge. Even while this so called investigation is still pending and Police Chief Williamson’s has indicated that he has already made up his mind and that he has decided his officers did nothing wrong.The family of Jorge demand an investigation conducted by an independent agency. Chief Williamson should insist on an independent investigation, at very least, to avoid the bias he has already injected into the process through his media appearances. He should immediately step aside from any involvement in this matter. The officers involved in the shooting, who have so far illegally refused to give statements, must be compelled to provide statements about their involvement and they must be held accountable for their conduct as required by the law.Ramirez was unarmed. He was apparently caught in a gunfight between several Bakersfield police officers and the fugitive he was ostensibly trying to help them apprehend, 32-year-old Justin Bryan Harger. Harger fired at police, striking Officer Daniel Brewer, who was hospitalized but released a few hours later.<a href=""http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/two-men-killed-in-shootout-with-police-at-four-points-sheraton-identified-091613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/two-men-killed-in-shootout-with-police-at-four-points-sheraton-identified-091613</a><a href=""http://www.kerngoldenempire.com/news/local/story/Man-shot-to-death-by-Bakersfield-Police-acting-as/d/story/r_lD60E-6UGy2yN0nFEflw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kerngoldenempire.com/news/local/story/Man-shot-to-death-by-Bakersfield-Police-acting-as/d/story/r_lD60E-6UGy2yN0nFEflw</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/Mom-of-man-killed-in-police-shootout-calls-it-premeditated-murder-224522001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/Mom-of-man-killed-in-police-shootout-calls-it-premeditated-murder-224522001.html</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x558589792/Police-release-names-of-officers-involved-in-fatal-shooting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x558589792/Police-release-names-of-officers-involved-in-fatal-shooting</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x196570287/Shooting-leaves-2-dead-2-officers-injured-in-hotel-parking-lot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x196570287/Shooting-leaves-2-dead-2-officers-injured-in-hotel-parking-lot</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/US-Marshals-Most-Wanted-Justin-Bryan-Harger-223952831.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/US-Marshals-Most-Wanted-Justin-Bryan-Harger-223952831.html</a><a href=""http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/police-received-information-on-hargers-whereabouts-prior-to-hotel-shootout-091813"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/police-received-information-on-hargers-whereabouts-prior-to-hotel-shootout-091813</a><a href=""http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/family-of-justin-harger-man-shot-and-killed-by-bakersfield-police-is-speaking-out-091913"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/family-of-justin-harger-man-shot-and-killed-by-bakersfield-police-is-speaking-out-091913</a><a href=""http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/family-of-slain-bakersfield-police-informant-demand-answers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/family-of-slain-bakersfield-police-informant-demand-answers</a><a href=""http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/officials-man-killed-in-hotel-shootout-was-police-informant-100813"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/officials-man-killed-in-hotel-shootout-was-police-informant-100813</a><a href=""http://therebelpress.com/articles/show?id=74"" rel=""nofollow"">http://therebelpress.com/articles/show?id=74</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1149424329/Legal-claim-filed-in-police-shooting-of-informant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x1149424329/Legal-claim-filed-in-police-shooting-of-informant</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x501561559/-This-was-a-trap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/x501561559/-This-was-a-trap</a><a href=""http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/2-suspects-dead-2-officers-wounded-in-shootout-223903971.html?tab=gallery&amp;c=y&amp;img=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/2-suspects-dead-2-officers-wounded-in-shootout-223903971.html?tab=gallery&amp;c=y&amp;img=0</a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/justiceforJorgeramirez"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/justiceforJorgeramirez</a><a href=""http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Justin-Harger&amp;lc=4239&amp;pid=167126707&amp;mid=5675726"" rel=""nofollow"">http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Justin-Harger&amp;lc=4239&amp;pid=167126707&amp;mid=5675726</a><a href=""https://usgunviolence.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/police-officer-wounded/male/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-6"" style=""color:#0f3647;""><img alt=""male"" height=""100"" src=""https://usgunviolence.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/male.jpg?w=47&amp;h=100"" width=""47""/></a>BAKERSFIELD, Calif. – Two men who were shot and killed at the Four Points Sheraton have been identified.The shootout happened at 12:34 a.m. during a traffic stop in the east parking lot of the Four Points by Sheraton hotel on California Avenue, according to Sims.According to BPD Public Information Officer Michaela Sims, a police officer — whose identity has not been released — sustained a moderate gunshot wound to the head.

            By <b>Update: <a href=""http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2013/09/sexton_alumni_residents_former.html#incart_2box"">The neighborhood and Sexton alumni show support for students</a></b><b>LANSING </b>What neighbors initially thought were fireworks turned out to be gunshots. Some saw two of the shooters hiding behind houses with guns at the ready for the victims, including one with a shotgun.""One of them was hiding behind the house next door"" lying in wait in a neighbor's driveway, said a resident who withheld his name out of fear of retaliation. ""All of a sudden, they're in the back of my house and I hear something that sounds like firecrackers, but then more rounds started going off and I knew it was a gun.""The resident said he came out of his house to tend to one of the male victims and watched as two of the assailants escaped in a tan SUV. Delia Pizana, a resident on the 1500 block of Ottawa Street where the
shooting occurred, said she too thought the noise was fireworks. ""I didn't know they
were shots. All of a sudden, I saw the kids scatter.""The three victims - two males, ages 14 and 15, and a 17-year-old girl - were taken to
Sparrow Hospital and treated for non-life threatening injuries, Lansing police
said during a press conference. A fourth victim came to the
hospital with a gunshot wound but it is unclear whether he is connected to the
shooting.<span style=""font-size: 12px;""> </span>""Parents, uncles, aunts,
sisters, and brothers need to step up,"" he added. ""For God's sake,
help us stop this senseless violence."" Sexton High School and other schools
in the surrounding area were put on immediate lockdown following the incident. Police say they are using all available resources to figure out what happened.""Violent crime will not be tolerated
in this city,"" Interim Police Chief Mike Yankowski said. ""Gun violence
specifically is not going to be tolerated in this city. We are working with our
federal, state, and local partners right now. We are out on the streets tracking
those who are responsible for this crime today.""Yankowski pointedly noted the
pre-planned nature of the incident, which seemed to stem from an incident
inside the school. ""This was not a random act,""
Yankowski said. ""Once again, our youth are turning to gun violence to settle
their difference over being disrespected; over getting dissed on the street. At
what point is the gun violence going to stop in this city?""I can assure you that those are
involved in gun violence in this city, and the violent nature of the youth and
young adults, we're coming after you, we're going to hold you responsible, and
we're going to keep this community safe.""For neighbor Delia Pizana, it was a sad afternoon. ""There was real bloodshed today.""Police ask anyone with information
on the shooting to call with tips to (517) 483-7867 or you can text an
anonymous tip to 847411 and start it with LPD517.<a href=""https://members.mlive.com/index.aspx?siteCode=MI"">Newspaper</a>

Two weeks earlier, they escaped from state Department of Human Services custody while being transported between facilities.Johnson, 16, pleaded guilty in juvenile court in May to assault with intent to do great bodily harm and was sentenced as an adult to three to 10 years in prison.On Thursday, he testified both he and Minor fired rounds from a car at the scene of a fight near Ottawa and Spencer streets on the afternoon of Sept. 17, apparently in retaliation for a previous shooting incident at his home.Johnson appeared reluctant to testify, covering his face and mouth with his hands several times and making barely audible responses, prompting warnings from Filice.Court records reveal what happened in 2013 gunfight near SextonHe said Minor, who was in the front passenger seat, fired the first shot from the open passenger-side window with a .380-caliber handgun. Johnson said he fired a .40-caliber handgun through the same window from the driver's seat.Johnson said he fired 15 or more rounds but didn't know how many shots were fired by Minor because other people at the scene also were firing shots.One of the shooting victims, a teenage girl, testified that two people were fighting on ""the island"" at Ottawa and Spencer streets before the gunfire erupted and ""everybody evaporated.""Besides the assault charge, Minor faced charges of felony firearm possession and carrying a concealed weapon. On Thursday, Filice granted a request by prosecutors to add a count of intentionally discharging a firearm from a vehicle."

Timothy Minor III
</span></span><span class=""character dateline"">LANSING – </span>Timothy Minor III is charged as an adult with assault with intent to murder, carrying a concealed weapon and felony firearm.At an arraignment Tuesday in 54A District Court, Judge Hugh Clarke Jr. set Minor’s bond at $150,000. Minor asked for a court-appointed attorney.The shooting happened Sept. 17, 2013 about two blocks away from the high school, shortly after the final bell. Three Sexton students — a 17-year-old girl and two boys, 14 and 15 — suffered gunshot wounds that were not life threatening. There was a fourth victim, a 15-year-old boy, who showed up later at a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Officials never said whether he was a student.A disagreement involving multiple teenagers led to the shooting. A group of students decided to go to the area where the shooting happened possibly to settle an argument, police have said.Minor, who was 16 when the shooting happened, was not a registered student at the time, according to Lansing schools spokesman Bob Kolt.A 16-year-old boy already has been charged as a juvenile in the shooting, officials said. He is not being named by the Lansing State Journal because he is a juvenile.A third teen, Narrion Lamont Caston, is charged as an adult in the incident — but not with firing a gun. Officials declined to discuss Caston’s alleged involvement. In March, he was ordered to stand trial on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and felony firearm."

576,480462,"A night of gunfire in west Kissimmee injured at least five victims this week who have not assisted detectives trying to find the shooters, according to the police department.The shooting began about 7:15 p.m. Tuesday on Flying Fortress Avenue.One man who had been shot in a leg and an arm was found at home, but most of the victims as well as the shooters left before the first patrol cars reached the neighborhood off Hoagland Boulevard, a report stated.The unidentified victim ""was not able to provide any information except that he knew who the people were…who shot him,"" the report stated.The victim said three men driving a newer model black car were responsible for the shootings. However, police later found another vehicle abandoned nearby that may have been involved in the shooting, the report stated.The grey vehicle parked at an undisclosed location had multiple bullet holes and blood inside.As police went door to door in the neighborhood, Florida Hospital Kissimmee and Osceola Regional Medical Center notified police that gunshot victims had showed up at their emergency rooms. One was a man who reported he was walking when he heard gunfire and ran home where he discovered he had been hit by a bullet, the report stated.A stray bullet also struck a house on Corsair Avenue and lodged itself in a painting on a bedroom wall, the report stated.""At about the same time this was taking place, we were notified by radio that there were two subjects with gunshot wounds at 1080 South Hoagland Blvd,"" the report stated. ""The subjects, who were driving a blue (vehicle) made contact with the resident who they did not know and asked him to call the police for help.""Anyone with information about the shooting is asked call Crimeline at 800-423-8477.<em>Hcurtis@tribune or 407-420-5257</em>"

580,480521,"A gunman with a military-grade assault rifle opened fire on a pickup basketball game in the Back of the Yards neighborhood late Thursday, injuring 13 people and dragging the city back into the international spotlight for its violent crime problem.At least 16 bullets were fired into Cornell Square Park around 10:15 p.m. on Thursday, wounding a 3-year-old boy and a dozen other people. All are expected to survive, many with wounds to their arms and legs.Shell casings found around the blood-soaked basketball courts were 7.62 mm rounds, which are traditionally used in AK-47 assault rifles and rarely found in gang attacks on Chicago’s South Side. Though gun violence has long plagued the city’s impoverished neighborhoods, offenders almost never use military-style weapons.“It's a miracle there has been no fatality,” Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said at a news conference this morning. “Illegal guns, illegal guns, illegal guns drive violence....A military-grade weapon on the streets of Chicago is simply unacceptable.”The park is in a heavily gang-infested area, but it is not in a so-called impact zone flooded by officers to deter crime, McCarthy said. The nearest zones are three blocks to the north and three blocks to the south, leaving the Cornell Square as a no man’s land protected only by occasional patrols and an 11 p.m. curfew.About 45 minutes before the park’s closing time, at least one gunman walked to the basketball court in the 1800 block of West 51st Street and opened fire, police said. The 13 people hit included both the pick-up game’s players and spectators such as 3-year-old Deonta Howard.Deonta, who was standing near the court, was shot near the ear and the bullet exited through his cheek, according to police and relatives. His family said the boy is expected to recover but will need plastic surgery.After visiting Deonta at Mount Sinai Hospital Friday, his grandmother Semehca Nunn called for an end to the violence that has terrorized her historically working-class neighborhood in recent years.“They need to stop, they need to stop,” Nunn said, before collapsing in tears.Police believe the shooting stemmed from an ongoing dispute between the Black P. Stones and Gangster Disciples. It was not known if any of the victims were the intended targets, authorities said.“There were members of gangs on the scene and there were gang members among the victims,” McCarthy said.Authorities do not have anyone in custody and are currently reviewing police cameras mounted nearby. There could be as many as three offenders, officials said.The first paramedics on scene found more than a dozen people lying across the rust-colored court. One person lay near a bicycle that was on its side. A pair of white gym shoes were left near an out-of-bounds line.Ambulances continued to arrive a half hour after the shootings as wounded people – including a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl – were carried out on stretchers. About 60 police officers converged on the park and crime lab investigators combed the scene. Witnesses say Deonta was the first to be carried away.The images again captured the world’s attention as international media organizations ran stories about the shooting and foreign reporters attended a Friday morning press conference at police headquarters.McCarthy repeatedly refused to address the incident’s toll on the city’s reputation or his department’s effort to curb gun violence. “Every time somebody is shot in this city, it’s a setback,” McCarthy said. “But this is not just a Chicago problem.”The incident appeared problematic enough for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to cancel a meeting with Obama administration cabinet secretaries today on city issues and return to Chicago, his spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said.Emanuel flew to D.C. Thursday to raise money for his campaign fund. His East Coast swing also was supposed to include a political fundraiser for Democratic New Jersey U.S. Senate candidate Cory Booker.Upon his return, Emanuel spent 40 minutes at Mount Sinai Hospital, where he spoke with Deonta’s mother. The boy, who remains in critical condition, was sedated and being prepared for surgery during the visit.The mayor did not speak with reporters, but released a statement asking the community to cooperate with the investigation.“Senseless and brazen acts of violence have no place in Chicago and betray all that we stand for,” Emanuel said in a statement. “The perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I encourage everyone in the community to step forward with any information and everyone in Chicago to continue their individual efforts to build stronger communities where violence has no place.”The shootings came just days after the FBI released crime data showing that Chicago had more murders than New York in 2012. McCarthy argued Friday that the statistics were old news and did not represent the progress made in the city, where the murder rate has dropped by 20 percent over the past year.Ald. Willie Cochran, a retired police sergeant whose redrawn ward will include Cornell Square in 2015, acknowledged the shootings landed a damaging blow against the city’s crime-fighting efforts.“It’s a setback because we’ve been focusing so much attention on suppressing crime,” he said. “If you look at where we were last year and where we are this year, it shows that. But the perception of crime is greater than the crime itself. While law enforcement has been implementing programs, putting more officers on the street on overtime initiatives, it only takes one incident like this to change the whole perception of the reality.”For neighborhood residents, the reality Thursday night included a burst of rapid fire and sight of a bleeding 3-year-old boy. Deonta’s older brother, Jamarrie Toney, was at his aunt’s home across the street from Cornell Square when he heard the shots. He ran to the park’s gate and saw his younger brother lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the face.Jamarrie, 9, had not seen Deonta – who goes by the nickname Tay Man – since paramedics rushed the little boy to the hospital. “I just miss him,” he said.Another victim, a 37-year-old man who was shot in the leg, said he had been hanging around the park with friends when the gunfire began.“I turned around, I heard screaming,’’ he said. “I saw Tay Man.""He paused.“I just saw his face. Just tore off. . .they almost shot his whole face off,” he said.The man, who asked that his name not be used, smoked a cigarette as he leaned on a cane after being released from the hospital. Medical tape held down a piece of cotton gauze on his left arm, and he was missing the shoe from the leg where he had also been shot.He denied feeling anger toward the shooter. “I’m just grateful, grateful to be alive,” the man said.Mayra Rodriguez, 23, who lives in the area with her 2-year-old daughter, heard rapid gunfire and then saw people on the ground. “Good thing most of them got hit in the legs,’’ she said.“That kid was playing, he didn’t even know nothing, it was out of nowhere,’’ she said of the 3-year-old.Relatives said the boy's uncle, Jerome Howard, was fatally shot in the Woodlawn neighborhood over the Labor Day weekend. The Rev. Corey Brooks, who presided over Howard's funeral, urged the shooter or shooters to surrender or face justice on the streets.“There are people who know exactly who the shooter is,” he said. “And I'm sure he will not be safe shooting 13 people.”As dawn broke today, broken glass could be seen strewn across the basketball court, along with discarded medical supplies, syringes without needles, plastic packaging, orange gloves and a bloody T-shirt.Before Thursday night's shooting, eight children under the age of 8 had been shot in Chicago over seven weeks.Police listed the victims as:• A 3-year-old boy, shot in the ear, in critical condition at Mount Sinai• A 17-year-old girl, shot in the foot, condition stabilized at Holy Cross Hospital• A 15-year-old boy shot in the arm, stabilized at Holy Cross• A man, 27, shot in the leg and wrist, serious condition at Mount Sinai• A man, 24, shot twice in the stomach, serious condition at Mount Sinai• A man, 21, shot in the leg, serious condition at Mount Sinai• A man, 41, shot in the buttocks, serious condition at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital• A woman, 33, shot in the shoulder, condition stabilized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital• A man, 31, shot in the buttocks, condition stabilized at Northwestern• A woman, 23, shot in the foot, condition stabilized at St. Anthony Hospital• A man, 37, shot in the leg, in good condition at Stroger• A man, 25, shot in the knee, in good condition at Northwestern• And a man, 33, who drove himself to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park with a gunshot wound to the leg and who was treated and released."

Humphries was on the street after being accused of another murder in July, and posting 10 percent of his $500,000 bail.Little more than three months earlier he was brought before another Cook County judge on murder charges after prosecutors said he and a second man flashed gang signs before fatally shooting Howard, of the 5300 block of South Hoyne Avenue, Champ, the ""main player"" in the Cornell Square Park shooting, had been convicted of gun possession as a felon last year, Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said at a news conference.A judge sent Champ to boot camp, and he was released when he completed the program.“If Bryon Champ is not on the street — as he shouldn’t have been — this incident likely does not occur,"" said McCarthy, who has advocated stricter sentencing for gun crimes. “He received boot camp for that gun crime and was back out on the streets to be a part of this senseless shooting.""<a href=""http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130928/back-of-yards/fifth-man-charged-mass-shooting-that-wounded-3-year-old-boy"">A few days after the initial arrests</a>Earlier this month, Darren Curtis, 28, was charged in the incident as well.Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Next in Copyright © 2009-2018, New York Public Radio.Copyright © 2009-2018, DNAinfo."

""I couldn't do much, but I did the best I could.""Deonta's mother, 24-year-old Shamarah Leggett, described her son as ""strong."" It's a character she's now trying to emulate herself.""He's doing better than I expected. He's moving around, playing,"" she told The 3-year-old is expected to undergo surgeries until he's 13 to repair his face. His mother told DNA Info that the bullet failed to cause any internal injuries to his brain.Young and Jett have been charged with three counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm.

Four people were hit and one of them, 21-year-old Randy Lee Jones, did not survive.He was not the only victim of this weekend's violence.<em><strong>See also:</strong></em>A witness told police he heard arguing just before the shooting.

Fighting in Old Town early Sunday morning escalated into gunfire that left one person dead and at least six injured, according to Sgt. Scott Brunow of the Wichita Police Department.Several gunshots were heard by Wichita police officers in the 100 block of North Mead in Old Town shortly before 2 a.m. on Sunday, Brunow said. “They responded and found six victims that had been shot,” Brunow said. “Several were transported by private vehicles to hospitals. A seventh victim did show up at an area hospital that had been shot, as well.”A 25-year-old man died from injuries from the shooting, Brunow said. Two other victims had been listed in serious condition but were later upgraded.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Victims ranged in age from 25 to 35 years old.Parking lots in the 100 blocks of Mead and Rock Island off Douglas just west of Washington were roped off Sunday morning with crime tape. Police vehicles were also in the area most of the morning as officers combed the parking lots for evidence. Pieces of clothing and bloodstains were visible in the lots.The incident is one in a string of violent occurrences at Old Town over the past couple of years.The acts of violence have typically occurred shortly after 2 a.m., when the bars close for the night.In March last year, five people were injured and a sixth man killed in an officer-involved shooting at a parking garage adjacent to the Hotel at Old Town. That shooting happened after a concert at Doc Howard’s Lounge as people were leaving.The Eagle reported at the time: “The 22,000-square-foot building at 252 N. Mosley has been the center of several violent incidents over the past decade. Most of them occurred around closing time for the clubs operating in the building. They include a shooting in the parking lot in 2003 that killed a 25-year-old man; a shooting in the parking lot in 2006 that wounded six people; and a stabbing outside the building in 2008 that critically injured two men and a woman in their 20s.”In response to the shootings, the Old Town Association hired more security and installed more security cameras. The Wichita City Council changed an ordinance to prohibit loitering between midnight and 6 a.m. and police have beefed up their patrols in Old Town on the weekends.Charlie Claycomb, president of the Old Town Association, could not be reached Sunday for comment.The shootings Sunday morning occurred directly north of The Wichita Eagle in the 800 block of East Douglas. At that time of the morning, the only employees on site are working toward the back of the building where the presses are located.Mike Hall, vice president for operations at The Eagle, said no staff reported hearing or seeing anything. But a few months ago, Hall noted, there was a shootout in The Wichita Eagle parking lot.“That’s when we decided we needed security,” Hall said.More details are expected to be released at a police and media briefing Monday.

Cottrill ordered a presentencing investigation.The first shooting occurred on Sept. 29, 2013, outside Hoppy's Bar on Putnam Avenue. Welch said Wilson was involved in a confrontation outside the bar and retrieved a gun from a vehicle before opening fire on a crowd, hitting four people with a semi-automatic handgun. The victims — two men and two women — were between ages 22 and 38.The initial police report states there were roughly 50 people outside Hoppy's at the time of the shooting. The officer who made the original call to dispatch called the incident ""about a half a riot.""Less than four months later, Wilson shot Isaac Thomas, 35, in a Spangler Drive home during an argument over a stolen weapon. After shooting Thomas, Wilson pushed his victim into the street, where neighbors discovered him a short time later, Welch said. Thomas was taken to the hospital but later died of his injuries.Chad Morrison also has been indicted on three felony counts in connection with the Spangler Drive shooting, including one count of complicity to aggravated murder. According to the indictment, Morrison was the getaway driver and lied to Zanesville police officials during questioning. Morrison is being held in the Muskingum County Jail until his Dec. 9 trial.The prosecutor's office would not comment on whether the two crimes were related but did allude to a history of drug activity on behalf of Wilson and Morrison.Wilson was apprehended by a Columbus Division of Police SWAT team in May after he allegedly robbed a man he'd called to ask for a ride.According to the Columbus police report, Wilson rode in the victim's car for a short time before robbing him with a black handgun.The victim told police that Wilson took his cellphone and wallet and then ran to 3656 Seabrook Avenue, which is Wilson's last known address, according to the report.""Our detectives worked really hard on this, put a lot of effort in, and it finally paid off,"" said Capt. Doug Merry, of the Zanesville Police Department. ""It's been a team effort between a lot of different agencies, but thankfully, it's over.""Wilson's sentencing date has not been set."

Wilson, 27, appeared in Muskingum County Common Pleas Court on Monday to be sentenced on two cases. Judge Kelly Cottrill accepted the state's recommended sentence for four counts in case one, and one count in case two.Wilson pleaded guilty in November to a September 2013 shooting at Hoppy's Bar on Putnam Avenue that injured four people. After an altercation, Wilson had grabbed a semi-automatic handgun from his car and opened fire on the crowd of about 50 people, officials have said.He was charged with four counts of assault, a second-degree felony. The state dismissed three other charges, including having weapons under disability, a third degree felony, tampering with evidence, a third-degree felony, and receiving stolen property, a fourth-degree felony, in exchange for the guilty plea.Cottrill sentenced Wilson to two years in prison on each count in that case, plus an additional three years on the first two counts, which carried a firearm specification, for a total of 14 years.Less than four months after that shooting, Wilson shot Isaac Thomas, 35, at a home on Spangler Drive after an argument over a stolen gun. Thomas was left outside bleeding and later died at the hospital. Authorities indicted Wilson on May 14 for the incident, eight days before his arrest.He pleaded guilty in November to one count of murder, an unclassified felony, for Thomas' death. The state dismissed another weapons charge in exchange for the plea.Cottrill sentenced him to 15 years to life on that charge, plus an additional three years for the firearm specification, for a total of 18 years.The sentences on all charges will be served consecutively, Cottrill ruled. Cottrill said his ruling was based on a pre-sentence investigation and the danger Wilson posed to the public.""I apologize for what I've done,"" Wilson said in court. ""If I could take it back, I would.""The state had reduced Wilson's charges in exchange for his testimony at Chad M. Morrison's trial last week.  but he was found not guilty of complicity to commit murder for giving the order to Wilson to shoot Thomas.Wilson had testified that he shot and killed Thomas on Morrison's orders after Thomas stole Morrison's .357 caliber handgun. Morrison, however, testified that Wilson had acted on his own when he shot Thomas, perhaps out of fear of retribution for the September shooting at Hoppy's.Morrison was convicted by the jury of two counts of obstructing justice for driving Wilson from the scene and lying to police the next day. Cottrill also found him guilty of a weapons charge for illegally possession a handgun based on previous drug convictions. He was sentenced to a total of five years in prison.<span class=""-newsgate-character-cci-tagline-credit-"">elagatta@gannett.com</span><span class=""-newsgate-character-cci-tagline-credit-"">740-450-6753</span><span class=""-newsgate-character-cci-tagline-credit-"">Twitter: @EricLagatta</span>"

610,480765,"FRESNO (CBS/AP) — A Fresno motorcycle club’s annual dance, which draws bikers from all over the state, turned into a chaotic gun battle that spilled into the streets, leaving one dead and a dozen others wounded, authorities said.The Fresno County Coroner on Sunday identified the fatality as 18-year-old Dejuan Gladney. The coroner didn’t list a hometown.The Fresno County Sheriff’s Department said shots were still being fired when the first of the more than 100 officers arrived at the Soul Brothers clubhouse at about 2 a.m. PDT Saturday.Sheriff’s spokesman Chris Curtice said in a statement that about 500 people were at a dance inside the clubhouse when shots erupted. The shooting quickly tuned into “a running gun battle” in the street outside the club and hundreds of partygoers were running for cover when the first officers arrived, Curtice said.Gladney and several injured people were found in the clubhouse, which is located in an unincorporated neighborhood of Fresno County called Calwa. Another victim was found on a nearby street.Curtice said the injuries ranged from minor to “extremely serious.” More than 100 hundred people were briefly detained and questioned, but no arrests have been made. Authorities have not released the names of the shooting victims.The Fresno Bee reports the Soul Brothers were hosting an annual party that included other California motorcycle clubs. The Bee also reported that large gatherings of bikers descend on Fresno twice a year, once in the spring and then again in fall. The Bee reported that gatherings frequently turn violent, but that police blame gangs for starting some of the violence rather than the bikers themselves.The club’s Web site is inoperable and no representative could be reached at the clubhouse. Old newspaper reports say Soul Brothers was formed in 1967 in East Palo Alto as a multi-racial club before moving to Stockton then Fresno. He club also has a Las Vegas chapter, whose phone rang unanswered Sunday.The Bee reports the Soul Brothers “patch” consists of a black arm with clenched fist crossed with a white arm.(Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco.

614,480961,"Pictured: The scene in Southwest Philadelphia after six people were shot on Sunday night.  Police say this may have been a drive-by shooting or even an ambush but, for now, cannot say that for certain.   Officers were called to the intersection of 54th Street and Florence Avenue around 7:00 p.m.   Of the six young men who were shot, one was pronounced dead at the scene.  Five other victims were rushed to area hospitals.   One witness, who did not want to give his name, said ""I hit the deck, that's all I can tell you.  I heard the shots and I hit the deck.""   The man killed was 23 years old.  Police say he was shot multiple times in the back and chest.  Another 23-year-old was shot in the chest and is in critical condition.  The victims in stable condition include three 18-year-olds and a 21-year-old.  Police say there are about 50 shell casings at the scene, which police believe came from multiple guns.  Investigators say no witnesses have come forward, and no suspects have been identified.   Police were interviewing some of the survivors.  Authorities don't know if some of the victims may also be suspects, so all are under police guard.  The victims were apparently part of a group hanging out in front of Los Papi's Deli and Grocery Store.

615,480961,"<em>By Elizabeth Hur, Andrew Kramer, Jenn Bernstein</em><em>PHILADELPHIA (CBS)</em>The shooting happened around 7 p.m. at 54th Street and Florence Avenue just outside a deli.Sources say a man walked up to the corner and just started shooting. A car believed to be with the shooter also pulled up on the opposite side of the group, almost boxing the victims in, and also began firing.The first victim was pronounced dead on the scene, while the other victims were rushed to area hospitals for treatment. One of them is said to be in critical condition while the other four are stable.None of the victims have been identified, but police say their ages range from 18 to 23 years old. All the victims are male.Police say despite the large crowd out at the time of the shooting, so far no one claims to have seen or heard anything.Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Monday morning that detectives will look to see if Sunday night’s shooting is retaliation from a previous murder in the area.“There was a homicide there in late September, at least in that area. We don’t know if any of the victims were alleged to have been a part of that, if that had something to do with it, or if this is a different kind of dispute.”Police say they don’t have any suspects identified.The shooting remains under investigation."

When authorities arrived at the scene, four victims were found dead toward the front of the home, all with gunshot wounds.

Police are treating the case as a homicide, but have not given any information about possible suspects or witnesses at this point.“The only thing I could say to ease the concern of the community is that it doesn’t appear to be a random act of violence that you would think the community would be concerned about,” Cpt. Danny Huff, an investigator with the Paris Police Dept.The investigation found that two other men were at the home at some point on Wednesday night. One of those men has been arrested on an unrelated charge. The other man has been interviewed by authorities.Paris is located about 100 miles northeast of Dallas. The city is home to around 25,000 people. Pastor JWT Spies said he’s been in touch with the victims families.“They are devastated. They are hurt.

Most recently, in January of this year, he was taken into custody for traffic violations.The Texas Rangers are also assisting with the investigation but police are struggling to establish a motive.

</a><a href=""http://tulsaworld.com/subscribe"" style=""color: rgba(189,0,0,0.91);""><strong></strong></a>Two Hmong men, Boonmlee Lee, 21, and Meng Lee, 19, were arrested at 10:59 p.m. Saturday, about three hours after the shooting. They were jailed early Sunday on five counts of each of shooting with intent to kill and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony. Boonmlee Lee, held on $390,000 bond, has an additional count of possession of a firearm. Meng Lee is jailed on $385,000 bond.About 40 to 50 Hmong community leaders met Sunday to discuss ""what happened and how to prevent it from happening again,"" Vang said.""At first the community was shocked and in disbelief that this happened in an open, public gathering,"" Vang said. ""We ask that the Hmong community and the mainstream community not be panicked. Our community leaders will work hard to contain the violence, and the police and the authorities are working on their side.""Vang said elected clan leaders, who serve as wise men and solve family and social conflicts, will speak to the families involved in the shooting. Clan leaders are typically chosen every two to four years, Vang said.""The consensus idea is to have a clan leader go back to the family and calm them down,"" Vang said. ""And to tell them that the people who were involved will be taken care of by authorities.""Police called the shooting a ""grudge"" Saturday, and Vang stressed that he did not believe the incident was gang-related, but a disagreement between two families that spilled over into violence.Saturday's New Year's festivities were hosted by the Xiong clan, Vang said, one of 12 or 13 Hmong clans represented in the Tulsa area. Each clan, as well as the Hmong Association, hosts an individual New Year's event for the entire Hmong community every Saturday leading up to the Hmong Traditional New Year in mid-November. The Lee clan event is set for this Saturday.According to arrest reports, Tulsa police stopped a suspicious vehicle in which Meng Lee was the driver and Boonmlee Lee was a passenger a few blocks away from the event center. Officers in the Tulsa police helicopter detected a heat signature from a handgun that had apparently been thrown into the grass near the vehicle, the report said.The vehicle was described by witnesses as leaving the scene moments after the shooting, according to the reports.When asked if it was possible there could have been more than two shooters Saturday, Tulsa Police Sgt. Dave Walker would only say the investigation was ""ongoing.""Leonard Busch, pastor of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, which has a Hmong congregation of 50 to 60 people, said there may be as many as 5,000 Hmong in Tulsa.""The Census for 2010 showed 3,000 Hmong in the state of Oklahoma,"" Busch said. ""But realistically there are probably about 5,000 just in the Tulsa area. I would imagine that happened because many Hmong didn't identify themselves as 'Asian' or as 'Hmong' in the Census.""Most live in the Tulsa area, but some have spread out into smaller areas such as Tahlequah, Sallisaw and Inola, Vang said.Busch said many of the Hmong who attended Sunday's service were shocked by Saturday's shooting. He was told by church members that the two targets of the shooting were members of the Lee clan, which would seem to dispel the ""gang shooting"" rumor some had heard, since the two alleged shooters were also members of the Lee clan.However, Busch said, gang membership is a problem in the Hmong community, particularly in California and in portions of the upper Midwest, where many Hmong had emigrated.""I think the Hmong community has been pretty good at heading that off here in Tulsa,"" Busch said. ""I think they have worked hard and have been very effective compared to elsewhere.""<strong>However</strong>Dylan Goforth 918-581-8451<a href=""mailto:dylan.goforth@tulsaworld.com"">dylan.goforth@tulsaworld.com</a>"

Ryan McCarthy, of the agency's criminal investigations division, said via email that the shootings that happened in the 7400 block of Santa Monica Drive generated a lot of tips, and that police hope the public will continue to provide information.""Our investigators are working closely with the victims in an effort to gather additional details related to the shootings,"" McCarthy's email states. ""Investigators were unable to initially speak with many of the victims due to their conditions on the night of the incident.""Two residents of the community said it was normally peaceful and that they have a lot of police officers who are their neighbors.Eller said police officers were not among the shooting victims.On Saturday, personnel from the Broward Sheriff's Office and a mobile crime scene lab could be seen outside the beige, two-story home, but BSO says it's Margate Police's case.

628,481254,"MARGATE — In an upscale, gated community like Cypress Cove — heavily patrolled and home to several police officers — even minor crimes are rare.So neighbors were alarmed when several gunmen engaged in a shootout last month that could have been ripped from a Hollywood movie. Four people were found sprawled on a front lawn and bleeding from gunshot wounds, two of them critically wounded.Now, investigators say the shooting may be linked to an international criminal enterprise involving ID fraud and drugs.""We don't know why for sure, but we suspect two cells involved in various criminal activities, ranging from ID theft, immigration fraud and other issues,"" Margate police Lt. Andy Zettek. ""We are not ruling out narcotics activity.""However, police have called a community meeting next week to report that the gunshot victims have moved out and that residents are not in danger.""I received a call from the association president who said they have fielded calls of concern,"" Zettek said. ""They want to know if this is something that will happen again.

""The shooting victims were targeted. One of them leased a house there.""That house, in the 7400 block of Santa Monica Drive, became a crime scene about 11:45 p.m. Oct. 18 when five people pulled into the driveway and the shootout erupted, police said.<a href=""http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/margate/fl-margate-shooting-folo-20131022,0,6888221.story""><strong>PAST STORY: Police receive tips in Margate quadruple shooting </strong></a>From the other side of a fence that separates Cypress Cove from Northwest 18th Street, one or more people fired numerous shots at four men and a woman as they got out of a Honda SUV, said Zettek.They and perhaps a sixth person in the house fired back, said Zettek. Several shell casings were found in front of the house.Four of those arriving at the house were wounded. They were taken to a hospital by Margate-Coconut Creek Fire Rescue.One of the victims, found inside a Chevy SUV parked in front of the residence, was helped inside by a neighbor, according to a search warrant obtained by the Sun Sentinel. That resident told police the wounded person carried a firearm inside with him.Another witness told officers that after hearing gunshots, she saw two men in the back of the house next door. Police set up a perimeter, and with the help of a police dog, found a man identified as Andre Lang ""hiding in the area,"" according to the warrant.One of the bullets fired during the shootout went through the garage door of next-door neighbor Jerry Pugh.""It was very unnerving,"" he said. ""My wife and I were asleep on the couch in front of the television. I woke up to this rattling sound. I went to look and my wife said, 'Get down. Those are gunshots.'""The next morning Pugh said he found a pool of blood on his lawn, and in the street and driveway next door the painted numbers 1 through 69, indicating the spots where police found shell casings.Pugh said Cypress Cove residents still drive by to see the site of one of the most memorable events in community history.""It's like the Charles Manson house or something,"" he said.During the investigation, Lang told police he had been the driver of the Honda. Two of the wounded victims confirmed that he was in the vehicle with them, police said in the affidavit.Lang was arrested, charged with loitering and prowling, and resisting arrest, Zettek said. He later bonded out of jail and vanished, Zettek said.After obtaining a search warrant, police seized from the home two foreign passports, a cellphone, two computers and a semi-automatic handgun.Of the people who pulled into the driveway, one is in federal detention on an immigration charge, one has left the country and the other three are believed to have left Florida, Zettek said.He said police were at the house Wednesday to confirm that it is empty.""Without a doubt, of the people that were shot, one was the intended target,"" Zettek said.Pugh said he had a friendly, say-hello relationship with the couple who rented the house, but also suspected something strange was going on there.""Lots of people coming and going at all hours,"" he said.Of the shootout, ""We're very lucky we didn't get hit by a stray bullet,"" said Pugh, an electrician. ""A bullet could have gone through the wall and hit my daughter right in the head.""Down the street, Karla Velez, 26, a mother of two, said, ""I never expected we would see anything like that here. But I'm not worried now. I walk by there.""The community meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Swift Management Solutions, 1750 N.

Behind a banana-colored home in rural southwest Miami-Dade, men had gathered around a cockpit to watch and bet on roosters as they jabbed and bloodied each other. But the violence spilled from the ring into the crowd of spectators when gunshots rang out, leaving two men dead and another two injured. The shooting took place shortly after 7:30 p.m. Sunday in the 19600 block of Southwest 168th Street. On Monday investigators worked to piece together what happened. Among those who lost their lives: Agustin Figueredo, 67, of northwest Miami-Dade. Rafael Garcia, 40, and Angel Rivera, 49, were both injured and were being treated at area hospitals. Neither man’s condition was reported. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. A fourth man, struck by bullets, died as well. Police have not identified him but said he was in his 80s.  Organizing, betting on or attending cockfights, which flourished in Florida in the 1940s, is outlawed in Miami-Dade. Cockfighting is illegal in all 50 states and considered a felony in 39. Yet such cockfighting rings have been a popular form of entertainment in this rural area of the county for years. Just ask Greg Barnes, 39, who used to live less than a mile west of the shooting site and now works at a nearby zoo. He said police busted a cockfighting ring near his former home. “There was a house with a lot of chickens, and every Saturday and Sunday you could just tell that something was going on,” Barnes said. “They got busted and people came through my yard,” trying to evade police.  On Monday, wild chickens roamed a property adjacent to where the shooting happened. On another parcel of land a short drive east of the scene, a farmer was tending to some 500 hens and cocks earmarked for sale in Puerto Rico. Workers at Blowing Rock Farms, immediately next to the property where the shooting took place, said their neighbors are “pretty quiet.” “Nothing, nothing, nothing at all,” worker Manny Lopez said when a reporter asked about any signs of cockfighting. The property where the shooting took place, 19651 SW 168th St., includes a one-story, 2,500-square-foot home built in 1984 with three bedrooms and three bathrooms on about 8.5 acres of land. Lazaro Perea sold the property to Luis Barroso in February for $70,000, records show; the real estate website zillow.com estimates its current value as $350,000. Barroso is owner of Barroso Auto Sales in Miami, and Perea is his sales manager. Perea, who answered the phone at the used-car lot Monday, had no comment about the shooting and said Barroso is in Puerto Rico. As of Monday night, police had made no arrests in the shooting.

Both were pronounced dead at the scene.Numerous shell casings were found at the scene as well.“Her friends came to my house and said that Jasmine had been shot,” Morris’ mother, Lisa Briggs, said.Briggs rushed to the scene when she heard about her daughter, who had only been in the club for about 15 minutes. At least four others suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds. So far, no motive was given for the shootings.Two or three other people also went to local hospitals with non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, which are believed to have been suffered at the same club.“Six people’s lives, six people’s families have been affected by this one person’s decisions to go in this club and take people’s lives,” Briggs said.Morris had three children – two boys and a girl.“They don’t have their mother, 21-years old and pretty as a picture,” Briggs said.  “Why? But, he’s going to answer to us why and even if we don’t get the answer he will be caught no matter what, even if he doesn’t say a word.”Police are currently looking to see if surveillance footage captured the incident inside the club.Anyone with information is asked to call the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Homicide Unit at If you’d like to donate to the family, you can at any PNC Bank, under the Jasmine Morris Memorial Fund, c/o Lisa Briggs.<a href=""https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/category/news/local/"" target=""_blank"">More Local News</a>"

The video showed their daughter’s death.”During the hearing in which Bennett pleaded guilty, Robinson’s father, Bennett pleaded guilty to the most serious charge of murder and to five of the 10 assault counts. He originally also was charged with first-degree manslaughter with a firearm and two weapons counts. The original assault charges carried two counts for each of the five wounded victims: one each for first-degree assault/discharging a firearm and first-degree assault/extreme indifference to life. The “extreme indifference to life” assault counts were dropped, along with the manslaughter and weapons charges, in the agreement Cretella worked out with Senior Assistant State’s Attorney But One month before the club shootings, he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell, for which he received a five-year prison sentence, and he then violated probation by committing the crimes at the club. At that point he had not begun serving the five-year sentence.Clifford told Bennett, who was stoic as he acknowledged all this information, that he must serve a minimum of 25 years.

He said Bennett was the figure wearing a white pompom hat.Other surveillance cameras showed that man’s appearances in other rooms of the club in the ensuing minutes. But before Pepper reached the point of the shooting, during which Podsiad was expected to identify Bennett as the gunman, Superior Court Judge Brian The jury never heard another moment of testimony. During the recess, Cretella approached the two prosecutors to inform them Bennett wanted to plead guilty to some of the charges. Fischer then dismissed the jury and everybody else went upstairs to Clifford’s courtroom for the plea hearing.When Bennett entered that courtroom, he was still wearing a red tie and dark suit but handcuffs had been put on him.Bennett quietly answered “guilty” to the murder charge and five assault counts.Clifford told Bennett that when he imposes the sentence, its length “will be up to me, after listening to the attorneys and other people’s comments.” This will include the relatives of the victims.When Clifford asked whether any family members wanted to speak right away in addition to on the sentencing date, Gregory Fulcher approached the podium. After thanking Clifford and the prosecution team, Fulcher also thanked “the Lord Jesus, that helped us through this from day one.”Fulcher said he remains angry at Bennett because “After court adjourned and Bennett was taken back to lock-up, Robinson’s mother, Celeste Fulcher, said she, too, was thankful Bennett had admitted his guilt. “That video, it was horrifying.”Gregory Fulcher then said, “There is no justice; it’s just us, standing, with anguish for the rest of our lives.”He praised Bennett because he came forward “to man up and say: ‘Enough.’”Fulcher remarked Bennett will not be able to apologize to Robinson on earth but that if he accepts Jesus in his life, one day he will be able to see her in heaven “and tell her in person that he’s sorry.”Call Randall Beach at 203-680-9345.

640,481419,"MIAMI GARDENS (CBS4) – As Saturday night got underway, Miami Gardens police swarmed a residential neighborhood off of NW 187 Street and 30 Avenue. They cut access in and out for several blocks in that area after a gunman opened fire on four men, ages 19-23.Neighbors stood around watching police gather leads, including shell casings and interviewing people.  Police said an unknown man walked up to a home where the four victims were sitting on a porch, started shooting, then ran off.The victims were airlifted to local hospitals, two of them in serious condition.One woman who lives a block away from the shooting told CBS 4 News she is frustrated and frightened because gun violence is increasing in the city she’s lived in for 20 years.The woman chose to remain unnamed out of concerns for her safety.  She said, “My other neighbors were saying they were afraid to even walk out. So, I’m considering moving somewhere, selling the house and moving.”  “As a police department, we’re very concerned that these individuals that are walking our streets are just simply walking up into these neighborhoods and opening fire,” said Detective Michael Wright, spokesman for the Miami Gardens Police Department.The anonymous neighbor, who is the mother of a 14 year old boy, said, “I’m afraid for him. I won’t even let him go to the park. And he’s upset about that. But, I value his life and I want him around for a very, very long time.”Police urge anyone with information to call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:

Libni's girlfriend had just left the shower and was trying to open the door and hold a towel around herself at the same time, he said, but he sent her upstairs to be with the two children.""That's when he fired through the door,"" said Libni, who was standing to the side at the time.“He didn't want noise. The dogs were waking him up. He always used to complain.”Guzzo then began to walk away as Libni raced up to the second floor, retrieved his gun and opened a window, he said.""A man's got to protect his family,"" Libni said.At the sound of the window opening, Guzzo raised the shotgun and fired, shattering the glass, Libni said. He said he had just ducked.""It's a miracle,"" he said.Guzzo then walked across the courtyard to his unit, went inside and fatally shot himself, police said.On Sunday, neighbors congregated on the grass between units, many with dogs. Others strolled, and several children rode bikes. Some stopped by the Moore home and left items including flowers, candles and a stuffed animal.Those interviewed said they were shocked by the violence committed by a ""quiet"" man. The president of the complex's homeowners association said crisis counselors were scheduled to arrive Monday.When the shootings began, several neighbors said, it sounded like construction.Barry Hatchett, 49, said he heard a ""boom boom boom boom.""""Then I heard four bangs,"" Hatchett said. ""I looked out the window and saw him (Guzzo) walking with a gun. Then he stopped and reloaded.""“This is an incident where we just don't know what sparked this.”Hatchett said Guzzo was walking across to Libni's unit. He called 911.Hatchett's wife, Charise, 42, said that Renee Moore had five dogs, all small breeds. She had just gotten several out of quarantine. They had been quarantined after she and her husband moved to Phoenix from China, she said.""Everyone who lived here had to know Renee,"" Charise said. ""She was always outside walking her dogs.""Shannon also was a familiar sight. He had a disability, neighbors said, and was often seen running to the school buOfficers who responded to the scene and searched for the gunman discovered the slain Moore family inside their home Saturday, and then Guzzo's body in his townhouse, Phoenix police Sgt. Tommy Thompson said.Thompson said Guzzo's motive is ""one of the troubling questions we have.""""There is some speculation that perhaps it may have been that Mr. Guzzo had a low tolerance for dogs or noise,"" Thompson said. ""This is an incident where we just don't know what sparked this.""There appears to be no history between Guzzo and the Moore family, and it did not appear that police had responded to either residence in the past, Thompson said.Guzzo apparently lived alone.Investigators hope the results of the autopsy reports can shed more light on the homicides."

    The woman says her ex-husband, Michael Guzzo, was a ticking time bomb as police try to determine what could have led him to kill three generations of a family, allegedly over a barking dog.
    <span class=""js-caption-wrapper""><span class=""cutline js-caption"">Michael Guzzo shot and killed four members of a family and two of their five dogs before taking his own life Saturday, Oct. 26, 2013, in Phoenix.</span><meta content="""" itemprop=""copyrightHolder""/><span class=""credit"">(Photo: Screengrab from KPNX-TV, Phoenix, video)</span></span>PHOENIX -- Michael Guzzo's life ended as his former wife predicted — at his own hand — but Janet Guzzo said she never envisioned her ex-husband killing anyone else as he sought to end his own deep depression.Guzzo shot a family of four, including an autistic 17-year-old boy, before killing himself with a shotgun in his Phoenix apartment on Saturday morning, according to police.<b>STORY: </b>On any other Monday, 66-year-old Bruce Moore, would have escorted Shannon Moore, 17, to the bus, neighbors said, so Shannon could attend classes at a Phoenix high school dedicated to meeting the needs of special-education students in a small-school environment.Instead, grief counselors met with students at the school, and many of the conversations centered around one theme: Why Shannon?""He was such a nice kid. How could this happen to him? Why him?"" said Craig Pletenik, a Phoenix Union High School District spokesman who related the questions that the counselors received. ""He was at home. Are any of us safe? If you are not safe in your home, where are you safe?""“He always was just such a troubled individual. You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' ”Police said many of the answers to the questions Shannon's classmates were grappling with  probably died with Guzzo on Saturday.Guzzo used a pump-action shotgun to murder Bruce and Shannon Moore, along with Shannon's parents, Michael and Renee, and two of the family's five dogs, in a townhome the family had owned for decades, according to police. Neighbors said Guzzo often argued with pet owners about barking dogs in the development, and police said Guzzo shot at another dog-owning neighbor on Saturday before returning to his own unit and killing himself.Janet Guzzo, who was married to Guzzo for more than a decade before they divorced in 1999, said the barking dogs and the presence of a weapon, coupled with Guzzo's extreme depression and increasing isolation, could have all contributed to Saturday's murders.""He always was just such a troubled individual,"" said Janet, a psychiatric nurse. ""You just knew it was coming. I said, 'Mike, something bad is going to happen if you can't get a handle on that rage and anger.' ""There were few new details Monday about the family Guzzo murdered, aside from school officials' comments and information available through court records.A relative of the Moores' declined to comment Monday when reached at her home.A neighbor who has lived in the complex for more than 40 years said Bruce Moore moved to the unit to care for a relative and that his daughter and her family had joined him within the last few years.Shannon was a student at Phoenix's Central High School before he transferred to Desiderata in April, Pletenik said. Word about Shannon's death had spread quickly through the tiny school Monday, Pletenik said, where about 40 students had met with counselors.""Something like this impacts them a lot because of the size of the school,"" Pletenik said.Michael worked at a pharmacy during the early 2000s when he also was attending college and pursuing a degree in criminal justice, according to court records.Renee and Michael were married in March 1996, divorced in 2004 and were re-married in January 2006, according to court documents.Court filings list Michael's employer as the U.S. Army, but government officials were unable to confirm any details related to his service.Neighbors said that Renee and Michael had recently returned from China and that Renee was excited to get her five dogs out of quarantine. Charise Hatchett, who lived nearby, said Renee left a note on Friday asking Hatchett to drop off her dog for a grooming appointment.The Arizona Humane Society took possession of the three dogs that survived the shooting.""It's just so tragic,"" Hatchett said.Janet said her ex-husband had never complained to her about his neighbors, but said his deep-seated depression, which grew worse with age, made anyone who set him off a potential victim.""It was a case of mental illness, and (he) chose not to address it,"" she said.""Sadness, isolation. It's hard to get your hand around it because it's not tangible. He is a nice person, and he wasn't a bad person; he did a very bad thing,"" Janet said. ""They were in the wrong place at the wrong time."""

Please read our wow, another senseless death in my old hometown. It is not safe to even fix a flat tire anymore there. Not enough cops to address these issues. I fear that it will only get worse.Maybe if cops didn't cost so much they could afford more.How much is your life worth?I don't know. But in this case I would say, a hand gun cost around six large & a round cost about 40 cents each (when Wal-Mart has them in stock). Cheaper if you can steal them......It cost around $200k to $250k a year in wages & benefits per cop. You knock a third of that off you would still have some of the highest paid public servants. If you could get three professional, highly trained cops for the price of two wouldn't that help?Not enough cops did you say? Sounds to me like you still don't understand the diabolical equation that is causing this American holocaust------ Welfare Great Society State Incentivized Out-OfWedlock Births + Police State And Corrupt Politicians = Lots of horrific crime and public expense!Wow, 8 people traveling at night in Vallejo without a gun? that has to be some kind of mystery! Shooter must have attended the party and had some sort of problem? I hope it wasn't random, it just gives other freaks with guns ideas! (Clarification for FDC et al: Freaks meaning not NRA and/or legal gun-toting citizens).More cops will not stop shootings.  Only more citizens with guns will.  Everyone should be armed over the age of 12!In a society where 99.9% of the people DON'T hunt their own food, remind me again WHY we need guns?I think it has something to do with protecting ourselves from the police or army or some other government agent who wants to enslave us.  The Constitution and rule of law are not enough, even if 99% of the people support them.But a better question is why can't we ID the gun?  The technology exists to ID any gun from a fired bullet.  Why don't we have national background checks and registration so we can then trace that gun to the last legal owner?Because of the number of persons who are encourage by gun control to hunt their fellow man, either for; pleasure, profit, or to cancel a debt of blood, ""honor"", displine, money or to a gang for themselves or another.cee rip, remind you again WHY we need guns?...With all the bad people out there, when seconds count the police are only minutes away..."
655,492914,"Four adults and two children were killed in a domestic situation at a Greenwood County home Tuesday night -- and four other children ran from the scene of the shooting to a neighbor's home, according to the sheriff.Greenwood County Sheriff Tony Davis described the scene as ""horrific.""Davis said the bodies were found in the home on Callison Highway after someone called 911 from inside the home and said they were going to hurt themselves.While officers were in route, a neighbor called 911 and told dispatchers that the four children from the home came to her house, and that they heard a shot fired, deputies said.Deputies said when they arrived at the house, they tried to get a response from those inside the home. When they could not, the SWAT team entered the home at 7:30 p.m. and found the bodies, said Davis.Davis said he believes the children killed in the shooting were 9 and 10 years old. The names of the victims have not been released.Davis said all of the victims were shot.""It's a situation that just takes your heart.  It's sad.  It's horrific,"" Davis said. ""Your heart just goes out to the family members and everyone involved,"" he said.The Greenwood Index-Journal has identified the alleged gunman as 27-year-old Bryan Sweatt.  He was among the dead, according to the paper.  A family member confirmed to News 4 that Sweatt was the shooter.According to court records from the Greenwood County Clerk of Court, Sweatt had two active criminal cases, one for petty larceny and the other for burglary.Court records also show Sweatt had 22 previous criminal charges dating back to the years 2005 and 2010.  Those charges included assault and battery, forgery, burglary and malicious injury.Deputies say they believe the gunman was dating one of the victims, but they have not yet named Sweatt as the shooter.Bernard Rush went to check on the children at the neighbor's house this morning.  He said they were all doing OK. Rush said the children who were freed by the shooter were all girls and all related to the victims.""This is just an experience you don’t believe,"" said Rush.  ""For all the family members to be gone at one time.  And that somebody could do this to somebody else.”Rush said the children are all with other family members now.Jeff Hicks, who has lived in the neighborhood for five years, told News 4 the couple who lived in the home had several grandchildren.He said the family had a dirt track on their property and children were frequently there riding 4-wheelers.""They were good people.  It's unreal that situations get this bad. It's awful,"" Hicks said.

658,492933,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB)---Five days after a deadly shooting inside a Radcliff building, the cleanup process is underway. A group of people returned to the scene Thursday, dragging items out to throw away. Our camera wasn&apos;t allowed inside, but when we stopped by, we could see bloodstains on the carpet. Radcliff Police officers were called to Shelby Avenue on Saturday morning around 3 a.m. for a deadly shooting.""When our officers arrived, there were cars literally lined from 31W all the way back to the scene...people trying to leave the scene,"" says Officer Bryce Shumate with Radcliff Police. Nearby neighbors watched the scene unfold as people were quickly leaving.""Yeah, it&apos;s a little strange. Even in Radcliff. It doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s something that should be going on. It&apos;s a lot of people there and everything,"" says neighbor Kelly Amoroso. Authorities found 47-year-old Darren Johnson of Radcliff inside, dead from a gunshot wound. His friends were fearful to speak on camera on Thursday, worried that something could happen to them if they do. Two other men were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Another man showed up at a nearby hospital. Police say he was also linked to the party going on inside the building.""Should the public be concerned at this point"", WDRB&apos;s Tamara Evans asked him. ""We&apos;ll we&apos;ve got somebody that is out in our public that was involved in the shooting incident that night, and they&apos;re not in custody yet, so any information that helps us to find this subject always makes our community safer,"" says Officer Bryce Shumate. ""So is it fair to say at this point that the person who died, Darren Johnson, is a victim,"" WDRB&apos;s Tamara Evans asked. ""The case is still under investigation,"" Officer Shumate replied. Police do say that they still need the public&apos;s help to solve this case and to help determine what happened inside this building early Saturday morning.""Nothing is too minor for them to call in. Any information that they can give us will help our detectives in the investigation,"" says Officer Shumate. The building where the shooting happened is a clubhouse for a local motorcycle club, but people affiliated with the group say they had leased the building out to another group on Friday, and it wasn&apos;t their event. The shooting happened early Saturday morning. We&apos;re told a party was going on inside. Anyone with information on the shooting can give Radcliff Police a call at their anonymous tipline. The number is 270-351-TIPS.<em>Copyright 2013 WDRB News.  All Rights Reserved.</em>"

He cracked the door open, saw it was a police officer and called for help.""It’s kind of incomprehensible,"" Stepenosky said. ""You go to the airport to go to a wedding ... and now he's in a hospital.""Friends, family members and colleagues were by the hospital bedside of the Calabasas teacher.""He sounds great, given what he’s gone through,"" Stepenosky said. ""He’s optimistic and upbeat, and he sounds exhausted.""Ludmer was one of five people shot during the rampage, including one Transportation Security Administration officer who was killed.Police blame Friday's rampage on suspect Paul Anthony Ciancia, a 23-year-old New Jersey native, who opened fire at a TSA document checkpoint of Terminal 3 of the Bradley International Terminal.The FBI announced Saturday that federal prosecutors will file murder charges against Ciancia in connection with the shooting.<a href=""http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/help-brian-get-back-on-his-feet/102787""><strong>Brian Ludmer Fundraiser</strong></a><b>More Southern California Stories:</b><ul><li><a href=""http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Touring-Warner-Bros-with-a-Warner-230244051.html"">Warner Bros.

663,492950,"Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty against the man charged in the 2013 attack that killed a TSA officer at Los Angeles International Airport, according to a document filed in federal court Friday.Paul Anthony Ciancia, 24, was charged with 11 federal counts in connection with the Nov. 1, 2013, attack, in which authorities allege he opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle in the airport's busy Terminal 3. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.<strong>------------</strong><strong>FOR THE RECORD</strong><strong>Jan. 2, 3:38 p.m.:</strong>------------Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo I. Hernandez was killed and three other people were wounded in the attack. Hernandez, 39, was the first TSA employee killed in the line of duty since the agency was formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The decision to seek the death penalty was made by Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. In the court documents filed Friday, prosecutors cited several factors that led to their decision, alleging Ciancia's actions were intentional and occurred after ""substantial planning and premeditation.""""By committing his crimes on a weekday morning in a crowded terminal at one of the busiest airports in the world ... Ciancia terrorized numerous airline passengers and airport employees,"" prosecutors wrote.Prosecutors also discussed the effect Hernandez's death had on his family and colleagues.Ciancia allegedly targeted TSA employees in the attack; investigators said they found a note signed by Ciancia saying he wanted to kill TSA agents and ""instill fear in their traitorous minds."" Witnesses to the shooting said the gunman asked them whether they worked for the TSA before moving on without shooting them.Ciancia, a New Jersey native living in Los Angeles, was shot in the head and leg during a gun battle with airport police. He spent two weeks recovering at a hospital before he was transferred to a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles, where he remains in custody.Los Angeles airport police Chief Pat Gannon said Friday that he felt the decision to seek the death penalty was appropriate, ""given the facts of the shooting.""""What a tragedy, all around,"" Gannon said.

Several minutes later, the clip shows police cars arriving on the scene.The house where two men and their girlfriends were gunned down is outside the frame so couldn't be seen and the make of car is not clear in the nighttime shot. The business owner said police didn't want the footage released at this point.A next-door neighbor called police after hearing multiple gunshots, police said.When officers arrived, they were able to see four people - two women and two men - shot in the residence, said Melissa Bujeda, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office.Three died at the scene and one was transported to a nearby hospital, where she died.""We have an individual or individuals at large who shot and killed four people,"" Bujeda said.The victims were identified as 25-year-old Derek L. Williams of the home, 27-year-old Gontrell M. Hagans of Timuquana Avenue and sisters Keshell L. and Keyonna S. Brown, 21 and 22, both of West 11th Street.Police said the shooting happened inside the house in the 1100 block and is one of three houses on the street that is a short block off Cassat Avenue in Murray Hill.Friday morning, about three dozen people gathered at the end of Randolph where a police line was established. Some people in the area said the home often had several people coming and going throughout the day. According to calls for police service to the address, it was not a problem home, Chief Annie Smith said.Johnny Hutchinson said one of the victims was his nephew, who he said had been shot once in the past.Hutchinson said he tried to mentor the younger man who he feared was living dangerously.""I'd just tell him it's not working,"" he said. ""Some people just live the life and don't know anything else.""Bujeda urged anyone with information to call the Sheriff's Office.""We want someone to step forward,"" she said.

His name wasn't immediately released.<b>STORY: </b>Craig said police are working with the U.S. Attorney's office to determine whether the man could be in violation of federal laws for being in possession of body armor.The chief says someone shot a high-powered rifle through an open door into a backroom at the barbershop, where Craig says at least 20 people were ""engaged in gambling activities.""He said the shooting, which he called ""urban terrorism,"" might have been the result of an ongoing feud between the shooter and people at the gambling party, Craig said.Craig said that police received a 911 call at 5:47 p.m. Wednesday indicating shots had been fired. He said police were on scene by 5:49 p.m.Two men who were struck inside the shop died on the scene, police said. The third victim, a 37-year-old man, died early Thursday at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Sgt. Mike Woody said.As bullets came in, many of the people who were gathered inside ran for their lives, taking cover at nearby businesses, including a party store across the street.The initial investigation, Craig said, revealed that 20 to 30 people were packed into a small room at the rear of the barbershop and were gambling.He said a man pulled up in a vehicle and started firing at a truck with a high-powered rifle. At some point, the rear door of the shop opened and the shooter began firing inside of the business. Craig said nine people were shot inside of the location.He said at least one person inside of the barbershop returned fire.Investigators were searching for men driving two Chevrolet Impalas – one white, one black – involved in the shoot-out along Seven Mile Road between Mound and Ryan at about 6 p.m. Investigators said a shoot-out between the cars' occupants in an alley behind the building spilled over into the barbershop.Police said the barbershop is known for gambling, and a dice game was taking place when the gunfire broke out. But a motive behind the shooting wasn't clear.Lorne Carter, 48, was smoking a cigarette against the wall of a nearby business when he said he heard about 30 to 40 shots fired around 6 p.m. near the barbershop in the 5200 block of East Seven Mile.""It sounded rapid,"" he said.Craig said all of the victims are male, but no ages or names were released.A distraught mother, who did not want to give her name, said she believes one of the men who was killed is her 40-year-old son. She said her three sons were in the barbershop at the time of the shooting, and one escaped and ran home to tell her and she rushed to the scene.""I heard he's dead. … They won't let me up there,"" she said from a gas station near the scene.That son had gone to the business to get bus money from his brother, she said. Her other two sons made it out uninjured.At the barber shop today, the only clear visible evidence that a shooting had happened were the news vans parked nearby and strands of yellow police tale flapping in the breeze at several spots.A painted sign on the gray brick building says the shop was established in 1971. A handful of playing cards could be seen among some leaves outside the front door, and broken window glass from a vehicle lay in the alley behind the one-story shop. No one answered the door at Al's, but next door at another business, a man spoke through a glass storm door, telling a reporter that ""it's over.""He warned against taking pictures of the shop and closed the door.Several neighbors who were out walking had heard about the shooting but few said they were in the area at the time.But Saifur Rahman, 19, was working at a fish and chicken shop across Seven Mile at the time of the shooting.He heard a series of shots that sounded like they came from an automatic weapon.Three people —all male, one older and two younger — ran into his shop and locked the outer door.

672,493842," The violence unfolded just before 11pm Saturday at a home in the 7300 block of Enchanted Creek Drive near FM 529.      The Harris County Sheriff's Office says at least 20 people were injured, and two of those victims are dead. HCSO authorities tell us Queric Richardson, a 17-year-old student of Morton Ranch High School in Katy, died at the scene. A 16-year-old girl died after being transported to Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center Hospital. Her name has not been officially released.  Richardson's father, Laurence Guidry, is having a hard time understanding how his two sons went to the party, yet only one of them came home.  ""Queric didn't deserve this. He was just a child,"" Guidry said. ""He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.""  Relatives told us Richardson, who would have turned 18 next week, was a good student and worked at a local Dairy Queen. His  16-year-old brother, Kenneth Guidry, was shot while trying to save him.  ""He was shot 10 minutes before he even realized he was shot, trying to help his brother,"" their father said.  Richardson's brother was one of 18 survivors who reportedly suffered gunshot wounds. A 19th victim has a broken leg, officials said.   Injuries range in severity. As of Sunday night, one person remained in critical condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital.    Sheriff Garcia said the problems began when party organizers took to social media to promote the event.  ""Anytime you promote a birthday party on social media, you have no control over who to expect at your door,"" Garcia said. ""What it does is indicate, that your saying to the social media world, 'I don't know who you are, but you're invited.' That's not a good practice.""  Authorities said there was no provocation and no evidence of a confrontation. The initial shot was reportedly fired in celebration, which caused someone to react and fire randomly into the crowd.  ""It is just a horrible combination of immaturity, access to a firearm and the inability to control oneself,"" Garcia said.   As the gunfire erupted, guests fled the home in a panicked rush to escape.    We talked to a young man who was at the party, who asked us not to show his face. He described moments of sheer terror as bullets went flying and people were scrambling to get away.  ""I'm by, like, the garage and the door with the other people. And I'm telling and pushing everybody like, 'Move to the garage,'"" he told us. ""Because I looked, and I could see him coming toward the door.""  The garage door is now bowed out.  That's where deputies say people were pushing, trying frantically to get out of the house.  The anonymous witness said the shooting went on for three to five minutes. When it ended, he walked by two young people who had been shot, trying to get to safety.  ""I saw one guy. He was lying on the floor with blood leaking out of his mouth and off his body and stuff,"" the witness said. ""And I saw another girl on the floor, and she looked like she was in shock, but she was also bleeding.""  The birthday girl said she was outside when the commotion began.  ""I was standing right there and all I heard was shooting,"" Boulden said. ""So I ran toward the house, but the door was locked. So my cousin grabbed me and we ran down the street and called 911.""   HCSO officials said investigators arrived within five minutes of receiving the call, and the sense of chaos remained.  ""Victims lying everywhere, people running,"" HCSO Dep. Thomas Gilliland described. ""Deputies were arriving, trying to figure out what happened, whether we had shooters on the ground, whether we had anyone with weapons still in the home.""    Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District officials tell us they plan to address the shooting Monday.   The district issued the following statement on Sunday:   Boulden said she never expected this to happen at her birthday party.  ""My brother and them were patting people down. [The suspects] didn't want to get patted down and they walked off.  And then I guess they came back and went through the gate,"" Boulden said. ""They weren't supposed to be here, whoever they were.""  There is an active search underway for two unidentified suspects -- ages 17 and 22.  Anyone with information is asked to call HCSO Homicide at 713-967-5810 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.

(Source: CBS 5 News)Scene of the shooting. (Source: Steve Aron, Nora OsmanNora Osman was killed Saturday night.The gunshots sent dozens of people running from the home. (Source: CBS 5 News)Phoenix police have identified the 19-year-old victim of a deadly shooting that happened at a house party on the city's southwest side.Nora Osman died as a result of the shooting Saturday night at 5800 South 53rd Glen, said Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump. Three others, an 18-year-old woman and two men, ages 21 and 22, were treated for wounds and released.On Sunday night, dozens from the south Phoenix community marched to where Osman was killed to remember her life and demand justice.""She was a great person,"" Osman's sister, Radwa Osman, said. ""She didn't deserve to die.""Police say the shooting happened as a house party of more than 100 people was breaking up and some kind of altercation occurred. They said shots were fired from multiple directions.""[The shooting and altercation] had nothing to do with her,"" Radwa Osman said. ""She was at the wrong place at the wrong time.""All of the victims were shot outside of the house and the suspects were believed to have fled in a vehicle; however, there were numerous vehicles leaving at the time, Crump said. It also appears that shots might also have been fired from someone on foot, he added.In 2010, the city of Phoenix created a Community Engagement and Outreach Team, whose task was to work with police to curb violent crimes specifically in south Phoenix, the same area Nora Osman was killed.A member of that team, Shawn Pearson, said that group made significant changes but violent crimes like Saturday's shooting serves as a reminder that there's still progress to be made.""[Teens] are doing these things out of ridiculous motives but they're doing them nonetheless,"" Pearson said. ""We've got to give them something to hope for.""Investigators have not released any suspect or suspect vehicle descriptions at this point.Nora Osman's mother told CBS5 News her daughter was in college and studying to become a pediatrician.Deqa Osman is asking the community to help bring her daughter's killer to justice and for the violence to stop.""I know whatever we do or whatever happens - it's not going to bring my kid back,"" she said. ""But, I don't want it [violence] to happen no more.""The Osman family is asking for donations to help with funeral costs.

680,493882,"A musician associated with an acclaimed indie band from Iran shot two members of the group and a third musician with an assault rifle in a Brooklyn apartment early Monday, before he went to the roof of the East Williamsburg building and turned the weapon on himself, law enforcement officials said.<span style=""font-size: larger;""><strong><em>UPDATE: </em></strong><a href=""http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Yellow-Dogs-Bandmates-Murder-Shooter-Upset-Kicked-Out-Band-Free-Keys-231633481.html"" target=""_blank""><span style=""font-size: larger;""><strong><em>Gunman Was ""Despondent"" Over Being Kicked Out of Band, Had 100 Rounds of Ammo</em></strong></span></a></span>The two dead bandmates, 28-year-old Arash Farazmand and 27-year-old Soroush Farazmand, were members of the Yellow Dogs, a post-punk band from Tehran that moved to Brooklyn after appearing in a film about the underground music scene there, the group's manager, Ali Salehezadeh, said.The third man killed, 35-year-old Ali Eskandarian, was a musician from Iran but was not in the band, according to Salehezadeh. A fourth shooting victim was shot twice in the arm but is expected to survive.Police said the 29-year-old gunman, Ali Akbar Mohammed Rafie, was upset because he had been kicked out of another band, the Free Keys, last year. It wasn't immediately clear why Rafie opened fire on members of another band, although musicians in both groups knew each other and some lived in the same building, Salehezadeh said.<em><strong>MORE COVERAGE: </strong></em>Rafie knew his victims but he hadn't spoken to them in months because of a ""very petty conflict,"" Salehezadeh said, declining to give specifics.""There was a decision not to be around each other,"" he said. ""They were never that close to begin with. ... This was nothing. We thought it was all behind us.""Law enforcement officials said the survivor called 911 shortly after midnight and reported the shooting at the three-story apartment building on Maujer Street.Responding officers found the three dead victims on the second and third floors of one apartment; Eskandarian and Arash Farazmand had been shot in the head, and Soroush Farazmand had been shot in the chest.Law enforcement officials said Rafie first started shooting from outside the apartment building, when he climbed down from the roof to a third-floor terrace and opened fire through a window, shooting Eskandarian in the head.Rafie then shot Arash Farazmand in the head in a third-floor bedroom and Soroush Farazmand in the chest in a second-floor bedroom while he was on a bed using his laptop computer, police said. An unidentified tenant was hit in the arm before Rafie and his former bandmate from Free Keys struggled over the gun until the clip fell out, police said. Rafie put the clip back in the rifle, went back to the roof and shot himself in the head.Two other people were in the apartment at the time of the shooting, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. They were affiliated with the U.S. Coast Guard and were in town for the Veterans Day Parade.Rafie's body was found on the roof of the building. Law enforcement officials say he shot himself in the chin, and the .308-caliber assault rifle used in the slayings was found next to his body. It wasn't clear how many shots had been fired.Authorities were still sorting out the motive and relationship between the shooter and victims.Kelly said the gun used in the slayings was manufactured out of the country and purchased in upstate New York in 2006.<div>The band came to the United States to pursue its dream of playing rock music in an open society, Salehezadeh said.</div>""You can't be a rock star in Iran,"" he said. ""It's against cultural law. You can't grow there as a band.""The manager added: ""They were great kids who people just loved. They looked cool and they played great music. ... They wanted to be known for their music. Now we're not going to get to do that."" Salehezadeh spent the morning on the phone speaking to the victims' relatives, who were stunned by the violence.""People don't own guns in Iran,"" he said. ""We don't have this problem there. It doesn't exist.""The band's video for ""This City"" is on YouTube: <iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""370"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/UYjJLjxeVG0"" width=""658""></iframe>"

									November 11, 2013 A musician furious over being thrown out of a rock band extracted bloody revenge in an early morning attack in Brooklyn Monday — using a military-style rifle to fatally shoot three people believed to be bandmates, wound another person and then take his own life, law enforcement sources said.The triple-homicide took place at 318 Maujer St., a Bushwick building where at least some members of the band are believed to live.The killer, brandishing a Century Sporter .308-caliber semi-automatic weapon with a 20-round magazine, showed up around midnight and opened fire on a person standing outside.That person was wounded.Then he stormed into the building and kept firing off round after round.<a href=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all""><img alt="""" class=""size-nypost-large-desktop wp-image-1686796 aligncenter"" sizes=""(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"" src=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all"" srcset=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 680w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 150w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 300w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=768&amp;h=508&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 768w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=678&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 1024w""/></a>Cops said the building was filled with spent shells.He fatally shot two people on the first floor and one on the third.The third floor victim was shot in his bed.The crazed murderer also fired into a first floor bathroom, where a couple was apparently hiding.They were not injured.Then he went to the roof of the building and shot himself to death.<a href=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all""><img alt="""" class=""size-nypost-large-desktop wp-image-1686795 aligncenter"" sizes=""(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"" src=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all"" srcset=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 680w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 150w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 300w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=508&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 768w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=678&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 1024w""/></a>The band is made up of Iranians who have been in the country for a while and were seeking asylum here, law enforcement sources.A neighbor, who identified himself only as Frank, said the building has been hosting boisterous parties.“During the summer it was ongoing, really loud parties with the street blocked off by gypsy cabs,’’ he said.“It was the usual hipster rave scene.’’Frank said there are several other party houses in the area.He described “huge blowout mega party — there must have been as many as 1,000 people” and a DJ on the roof of another area neighborhood building.That party happened in late summer, he said.Adding to the chaos in the neighborhood, another man was shot in the leg a few blocks away. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital.The two shootings were apparently unrelated, cops said.<em>Additional reporting by Amanda Lozada</em>

									November 11, 2013 A musician furious over being thrown out of a rock band extracted bloody revenge in an early morning attack in Brooklyn Monday — using a military-style rifle to fatally shoot three people believed to be bandmates, wound another person and then take his own life, law enforcement sources said.The triple-homicide took place at 318 Maujer St., a Bushwick building where at least some members of the band are believed to live.The killer, brandishing a Century Sporter .308-caliber semi-automatic weapon with a 20-round magazine, showed up around midnight and opened fire on a person standing outside.That person was wounded.Then he stormed into the building and kept firing off round after round.<a href=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all""><img alt="""" class=""size-nypost-large-desktop wp-image-1686796 aligncenter"" sizes=""(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"" src=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all"" srcset=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 680w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 150w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 300w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=768&amp;h=508&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 768w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn3.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=678&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 1024w""/></a>Cops said the building was filled with spent shells.He fatally shot two people on the first floor and one on the third.The third floor victim was shot in his bed.The crazed murderer also fired into a first floor bathroom, where a couple was apparently hiding.They were not injured.Then he went to the roof of the building and shot himself to death.<a href=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all""><img alt="""" class=""size-nypost-large-desktop wp-image-1686795 aligncenter"" sizes=""(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"" src=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all"" srcset=""https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=680&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 680w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 150w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 300w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=508&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 768w, https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/brooklyn2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=678&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all 1024w""/></a>The band is made up of Iranians who have been in the country for a while and were seeking asylum here, law enforcement sources.A neighbor, who identified himself only as Frank, said the building has been hosting boisterous parties.“During the summer it was ongoing, really loud parties with the street blocked off by gypsy cabs,’’ he said.“It was the usual hipster rave scene.’’Frank said there are several other party houses in the area.He described “huge blowout mega party — there must have been as many as 1,000 people” and a DJ on the roof of another area neighborhood building.That party happened in late summer, he said.Adding to the chaos in the neighborhood, another man was shot in the leg a few blocks away.

683,494033,"  According to the Houston Police Department, the trouble started around midnight during a large house party at a home in the 4400 block of Tiffany at Castlereagh. The gathering, they said, was mostly young people -- 17- and 18-year-olds.                  At some point, a couple of cars reportedly drove by the party and there was a disagreement of some sort. That's when someone pulled a gun and started shooting.                   Neighbors told us they heard 25 to 30 gunshots.  One neighbor rushed to help after seeing a young man lying in the street.  ""I got down and I was checking his breathing rate, his respiratories, and they were faint, but they were there,"" neighbor Jasmone Goodeau said. ""So we started talking to him and it seemed like it helped because I could hear him swallowing and trying to breathe more.""  By the time officers arrived, that victim was dead. He was identified as 17-year-old Yates High School student Braveon Terry. Police said he was shot in the chest. Witnesses said he also may have been hit by a car that was fleeing the scene.   A second gunshot victim was transported from the scene to an area hospital in unknown condition.  Police said two other victims drove to a donut shop on Hiram Clarke at West Orem with injuries to their legs. They were also taken to the hospital and are expected to be OK.   One neighbor who was passing by had at least two bullets hit her car.  ""I thought that I got actually shot because I saw the bullet, I saw him actually shooting, and all I could think is I got hit because I had blood dripping down my face and my eye was swollen,"" neighbor Juliette Goodeau said. ""Like right now I can still feel glass fragments in my face.""  We asked the woman who hosted the party about what happened, but she had no comment.  Police are interviewing witnesses for a description of the shooter. Anyone with information is asked to call HPD Homicide or Crime Stoppers.  Yates High School officials said they will have counselors there Monday for students and staff.   Houston's police chief is speaking plainly to parents in this city after this latest house party shooting.  ""You should not turn your house over to teens to have a party,"" HPD Chief Charles McClelland said.  McClelland spoke to local teenagers Saturday at the police department headquarters on Travis. He talked about a variety of issues facing teenagers, including violence in communities. But he also took the time give parents advice.  ""Parents should always be cautious of some things in your home because in some instances, as a parent or guardian or owner of the home, you can be criminally responsible for some of the things that goes on at your house,"" he said.   The police chief also reminded parents to be aware of their child's activities on social media, and he urged neighbors to report any illegal activity they see in their community.   "

Neighbor Tristan Coleman says he was upstairs when he heard about six gunshots firing from the apartment below.  ""Like the first 2 shots, it sounded like loud knocking; then I knew after the third one, it was gunshots. Then I heard a door slam,"" he said.   Sheriff's department sources tell Eyewitness News the victims were sitting on a couch and killed one by one. All three of the victims were shot in the head, and were each shot multiple times. Aside from the three deceased victims, two other people were also shot.  They were flown by Life Flight to Memorial Hermann Hospital.  Both were listed in critical condition.

The slain victims has been identified as 17-year-old Veronica Hernandez, 21-year-old Yosselyn Alfaro and 17-year-old Daniel Munoz.  ""He was like a brother to me. He was a sweet person, never disrespectful to any of our family members or anything,"" Munoz's cousin, Viri Ortega said.  At this time, detectives are still investigating what caused the suspect to shoot five people. However, authorities said the victims have connections to gangs in the area.  Munoz's family said he had fallen in with a rough crowd, but that he was not a gang member. After a stint in juvenile detention, they felt he had found God and could have accomplished anything.  ""We're just sad that he was taken from us so quickly and that we didn't have a proper goodbye or enough time with him,"" Ortega said.   Detectives say Sanchez allegedly has ties to a well-known street gang.   ""Coming home, we used to see, like, a lot of people just posted up right by the stairs, or just hanging out like they just didn't belong here,"" Coleman said.  The shooting has left neighbors on edge, and their biggest fear...  ""My life, you never know. You don't know if he's still around here, or if he -- you just don't know at all,"" neighbor Shaneika Mumphrey said.

692,494155,"2 Min Read(Reuters) - Four people were killed and one person was wounded in a shooting at a reputed drug house in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where methamphetamine has been dealt and used, police said on Sunday. Police responded at 7:15 p.m. on Saturday to a call reporting a multiple shooting at a house in the city’s north side where they found two people shot to death and three wounded, said Tulsa Police Department captain Dave Roberts in a video posted on the Tulsaworld.com website. Tulsa Police sergeant Dave Walker indicated in a statement on Sunday that two of the wounded had died. He said those killed were three women, 35, 46 and 54 years old and a 34-year-old man. Walker did not release the wounded person’s gender, age or condition. Investigators believe methamphetamine was recently used and sold at the house, he said. “We do not believe that this murder was a random act,” Walker said in the statement, adding that robbery was not the motive. A single shooter was responsible for the shootings that happened in a single room of the house, Roberts said in the video. Police said on Sunday they had not identified any suspects.

The Tulsa World reported that officers are looking for a suspect.Police said a shooting involving multiple victims was reported to authorities about 7 p.m. Investigators said the home had been the scene of several drug arrests.Officers arrived to find two people dead, a man and a woman both between 30 and 40 years old, responders said. A second woman, who appeared to be in her 50s, was pronounced dead at a hospital, said Kelli Bruer, EMSA spokeswoman.Sgt. Dave Walker of the Tulsa Police Department told television station KOTV that the fourth victim was a woman in her 50s. Officials said a fifth person was hospitalized in serious condition.Capt. Dave Roberts said the investigation had yet to reveal a motive. There is an indication that the suspect might have known the victims.“We have someone who said they heard a vehicle leave rapidly after the shooting happened and so we believe he left in a vehicle,” Roberts said.Officers who arrived on the scene found a back door open. The victims did not initially answer police who called to them from the doorway, but the officers soon heard sounds of distress and entered a converted garage area, Roberts said.More people were in another part of the house at the time of the shooting, he said. They remained at the scene and were cooperating with police.Bruer said medics also evaluated an uninjured child at the home.Police said the home had been the scene of several drug arrests within the last year, including at least five occasions where officers were called to the location.Rodger Gibson, who has lived in the neighborhood for almost a year, said he has tried to avoid the home because he “could tell it is trouble.”“I could not believe it,” Gibson said about the shooting. “I couldn’t believe they shot that many people.”Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.<span style=""font-weight:bold"">First Amendment:</span>"

Any murder is a tragedy. Each victim had family and friends who loved them. But police don&apos;t want citizens living in fear, thinking this is a random shooting that could happen to anyone.In no way did these victims deserve this, but detectives say their lifestyle did put them at greater risk for violence.Records show Randy Ethridge lives in the house where the shooting took place Saturday night and is the sole survivor. He was charged last February for selling meth, according to court documents.When he didn&apos;t show up for court in October, a warrant was issued. When officers arrested him on that warrant recently, they said he had more meth on him. Charges have been filed, but both cases are still pending.<a href=""/story/24057578/tulsa-police-id-four-killed-in-saturday-shootings"" target=""_self""><strong><em>11/24/2013 Related Story: Tulsa Police ID Four Killed In Saturday Shootings</em></strong></a>Police say he wasn&apos;t cooperating at first, but is now offering more information.""The survivor has been about as helpful as any meth addicted, drug dealing person is. Initially, he lied, didn&apos;t tell the whole truth,"" said Sergeant Dave Walker, Tulsa Police Department.Police say Ethridge was in a relationship with Glenda Harper, one of the four people killed in the house Saturday night. Records show she&apos;s served time in prison for selling drugs.The other couple killed inside the home was Charlie and Melissa Dake. Records show they were married in 2007 and he has convictions for larceny. She pleaded guilty to domestic assault and battery this past summer.The fifth person in the house was Tammy Brunson, who also goes by Tammy Ingram. Police say trying to get information from witnesses who are associated with a meth lifestyle makes for slow going.""They&apos;re paranoid of law enforcement, not getting the right story the first time or second time. So we go back and forth, back and forth. Be nice if they gave us the story right away, and we could get on with it,"" Walker said.Sergeant Walker said the shooter went into the house through the garage, went down a short hallway and turned left into the main living area, where all five people were hanging out. He said the confined space made it nearly impossible for the victims to get away from the bullets.If you know anything that can help police solve this case, call Crime Stoppers at 918-596-COPS."

</a><a href=""http://tulsaworld.com/subscribe"" style=""color: rgba(189,0,0,0.91);""><strong></strong></a>Randy Ethridge, 55, was wounded in the arm.Investigators speculate that documented methamphetamine use and trafficking at the home was a factor in the shootings but they have yet to uncover any substantial leads or evidence.""We're not getting anything that has any traction,"" said Sgt. Dave Walker of the Tulsa Police Department's homicide unit. ""That's unusual for a methamphetamine-driven case. Usually you can't get people to shut up.""The shootings were Tulsa's second quadruple homicide this year, following the gunshot deaths of four women at the Fairmont Terrace apartment complex near 61st Street and Peoria Avenue on Jan. 7.Similar to the north Tulsa case, the early weeks of the Fairmont Terrace investigation were slow until the day before a Feb. 6 press conference. At that gathering, 30 days after the killings, police announced the arrests of brothers James and Cedric Poore, one of whom lived in the building where the women were slain.""The Fairmont Terrace one ran so fast, so quick,"" Walker said.""We were getting so much information and going in so many different directions. And the media really was on that. (Local media) were on it a lot more than you are on this one.""Walker said his team retraced their steps in the Fairmont Terrace case and eventually came up with a break.""It was just a matter of settling down and going back over what we did and what we needed to do, and do over,"" he said.Detectives recanvassed the complex area and found additional witnesses.The scenes of both quadruple homicides saw high traffic, but for different reasons.As an apartment complex, Fairmont Terrace had residents with no direct connection to the homicides coming and going around the time of the shootings, which occurred around noon.Walker said 20 to 30 people who had frequented the North New Haven residence have been interviewed by detectives.""Trafficking amounts"" of meth were found in the home in January, he said.Less than 24 hours after the New Haven homicides, detectives issued a news release that stated, ""The residence has been the scene of several arrests for illegal narcotic dealing in the past year."" Walker clarified to the Tulsa World the drug being dealt was meth.Beyond that, investigators have uncovered little else.Information regarding the Fairmont Terrace victims' drug abuse and suspected dealing did not come to light until a Feb. 9 Tulsa World story cited police affidavits and other documents filed with Tulsa County District Court.Walker said the amount of drugs involved in the Fairmont Terrace case was small.In the north Tulsa case, at least one of the victims' family members is confident that Ethridge, who goes by Pops and has been described by police as a known drug dealer, knows more than he has told detectives.Walker said police immediately focused on Ethridge as a possible cause of the shootings because of his pending methamphetamine charges. Ethridge, Harper, Melissa Dake and Charlie Dake were the home's residents.Ethridge recently agreed to an interview with the Tulsa World but later canceled.Walker said he has spoken with Ethridge multiple times since the shooting. Ethridge has since returned to the residence.Court records show that Ethridge was charged in January with methamphetamine trafficking and in November with unlawful possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. Documents filed in those cases refer to the room where the shooting occurred as belonging to Ethridge.""He's the one you automatically focus on, or that we did automatically focus on,"" Walker said. ""(We've asked) who's mad at you and why? How much money do you owe? But, of course, dope dealers don't really create a lot of records.""He said there's nothing that he brings that would cause this type of carnage. So right now we're stuck with that answer.""On Dec. 4, Ethridge posted a message on his Facebook account to Harper, who's listed as his girlfriend. It reads ""rest in peace pxy ill always miss you!""Linda Harper, Harper's former sister-in-law, said Glenda, who everyone called Pixie, is remembered as a caring woman who was always there for family members in their times of need.She said Glenda provided her family with shelter ""without question"" when they needed it years ago.""I knew her as a law-abiding family-type mother to all,"" Linda said. ""I'm not sure what happened in her life to change the path she was on when we knew her. She was nonjudgmental and forgiving.""The Dakes were apparently staying with Ethridge and Harper after having been displaced from their home, said Charlie Dake's brother, Matt.""We all love him and miss him,"" Matt Dake said. ""I don't know how someone could do this  take four lives just like that.""He said the last time he talked to Charlie was three or four months ago. He said he and his brother, two of ""at least 14"" kids from a blended family, would often go weeks or even months between conversations.He described his brother as very active and an outdoorsman who loved to hunt, fish and ride dirt bikes.""He was a lot of fun,"" Matt Dake said. ""Everyone loved him.""Charlie and his wife, who went by Missy, had six children from their previous relationships. The kids have been split up and are staying with various family members in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Matt Dake said.Lacie Pineda said she believes her slain mother, Tammy Brunson, was at the residence on North New Haven at the time of the shooting because she routinely checked on some friends there, as well as the children who were living in the residence.""She wanted to do everything for everyone,"" Pineda said. ""That's who she was.""That house, those were friends. She loved them and she'd go there to confide in them or to listen to their problems. I guarantee you she was there for a visit, to check up on them. That was the kind of person she was.""Dylan Goforth 918-581-8451<a href=""mailto:dylan.goforth@tulsaworld.com"">dylan.goforth@tulsaworld.com</a>Amanda Bland 918-581-8413<a href=""mailto:amanda.bland@tulsaworld.com"">amanda.bland@tulsaworld.com</a>Jan. 7: Misty Nunley, 33; Julie Jackson, 55; Rebeika Powell, 23; and Kayetie Powell Melchor, 23, found bound and executed in Powell's apartment.Jan. 14: Suspect Cedric Dwayne Poore is booked into the Tulsa Jail on a request from the Department of Corrections and for outstanding traffic warrants.

Their names were not released. Outside the Hillside home of Woodley Daniel yesterday afternoon, at least a dozen friends and relatives gathered, crying and hugging each other. “We were born several days apart,” said Noah Joseph, 32, a cousin. “Our mothers carried us in their wombs at the same time.” Joseph said Daniel was originally from Irvington and had moved to Hillside. “He was very loved,” Joseph said, voice cracking. “He had many nieces and nephews and he was a father to all of them. He was a good man with a heart of gold. Anyone who knows him will say that about him. He was a protector. He was a hero.”Pierre Clervoyant Sr., who owned Slick’s, said two men came to the bar at around 12:30 a.m. He said they were denied entry because “they were clearly drunk.” His son approached the men “to calm the situation down,” as their argument with Daniel moved outside. One of the men then pulled out a gun and fired, he said, killing Daniel and Clervoyant Jr., wounding two others and fatally shooting Cureton. “He was trying to be the peacemaker,” said Stephanie Clervoyant, 25, the sister of the bar manager. She wore his New York Knicks pullover, gathering along with other family at their Elizabeth home.Clervoyant lived upstairs from his parents with his wife, Candice Clervoyant — a maternity nurse at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston — and their daughter Jaidyn, who turned 6 on Sunday. “Everyone knew Pierre because of his smile,” she said,” calling him a mentor to youth in the Haitian community. “He was better than a great father,” she said. “He was excellent. He was kind and compassionate.”A Facebook account for Clervoyant, a graduate of Fairleigh-Dickinson University, has a photo of his daughter as the profile picture. She sits on an ottoman, wearing flower barrettes in her hair. On both Instagram and Facebook, messages mourned the bar manager. “My prayers and condolences goes out to my Slicks family in Irvington,” read one post. “Such sad news to wake up to this morning on a day like this.”In addition to managing the bar, Clervoyant worked for the city of Elizabeth, in the Office of Aging, which runs programs for seniors. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage, reached by email yesterday, called him “A great young man who had everything going for him.”Pierre Clervoyant Sr. says police took a computer containing footage from surveillance cameras.Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray and Joseph Santiago, Irvington Police director, said Irvington Police and the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force are investigating the shooting. Its Crimestoppers program announced a $10,000 reward for information that would help in the arrest and conviction of a suspect.The Irvington bar has been the scene of at least two other shootings in recent years. Steven Charles, 24, of Irvington, was fatally shot after an argument outside the bar in August of 2010.<em>Star-Ledger staff writers Mark Di Ionno and Lisa Rose contributed to this report</em><br/>• •

            By RACELAND, La. -- A south Louisiana man The shootings happened at four locations in two parishes about 45 miles southwest of New Orleans on Thursday. The first report came about 6:40 p.m., when Lafourche Parish Councilman Louis Phillip Gouaux -- who was shot in the throat -- called 911 from his home in Lockport, Houma, La., The suspect, Ben Freeman, 38, was the ex-husband of Gouaux's daughter Jeanne, Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Brennan Matherne said in a news release.Gouaux's wife, Susan ""Pixie"" Gouaux, was dead when deputies arrived, Matherne said. Louis Phillip Gouaux and his daughter, Andrea Gouaux, were injured and taken to Interim LSU Public Hospital in New Orleans. Both were in critical but stable condition, Matherne said.About 20 minutes later in Raceland, Ochsner St. Anne General Hospital administrator Milton Bourgeois was shot and killed at close range at his home, Matherne said. His wife, Ann Bourgeois, was shot and taken to the New Orleans hospital, where she was listed in stable condition.Raceland police said Bourgeois was shot at close range and his wife was shot in the leg.Freeman had been employed at three area hospitals over the last few years, including St. Anne, where Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said he had been a registered nurse before he was fired in 2011. All three hospitals were put on lockdown for a while Thursday.Freeman's wife, Denise Taylor Freeman, was found dead in the couple's home in Houma in Terrebonne Parish. Matherne said her cause of death was not immediately known.A shotgun was used in the shootings, deputies said.Ben Freeman was found along U.S. Highway 90 near Bayou Blue, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.The Lafourche Parish sheriff said Jeanne Gouaux had filed multiple protective orders against Freeman, who had pleaded guilty to harassment charges and was allowed only supervised visits with their four children. The last protective order expired less than a month ago, he said.""Clearly, there has been a very difficult and complicated divorce/custody issue going on,"" Webre said during a news conference late Thursday.Webre could not comment on why Ben Freeman was terminated from St. Anne Hospital, but noted that police were called there after Freeman damaged a room. He told police then that he would seek mental help, Webre said.

733,496584,"A Louisiana man went on a bloody rampage Thursday, killing his wife, the head of a hospital where he once worked and his former mother-in-law — the wife of a local councilman — before fatally turning the gun on himself, authorities said.Ben Edward Freeman, 38, began his deadly shooting spree when he burst into a home in the town of Lockport about 45 miles southwest of New Orleans and shot Lafourche Parish Councilman Louis Phillip Gouaux and his wife, Susan, shortly before 7 p.m., authorities said.Freeman also wounded the councilman's daughter, Andrea Gouaux - the sister of the gunman's ex-wife - in the shooting, police said.Susan (Pixie) Gouaux died before emergency workers arrived, but her husband and daughter survived. Both were listed in critical condition at University Hospital.About 20 minutes after the violence, Freeman allegedly went to a Raceland home and shot Milton Bourgeois, the CEO of Ochsner St. Anne General Hospital.Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Brennan Matherne Police soon identified Freeman as the shooter and swarmed his Houma home, where they found his wife — Denise Freeman — dead in a bathtub. Her cause of death was not immediately released.The couple had a history of domestic violence, and courts had issued at least two protective orders, the most recent expiring last month, The news station also reported that Freeman — who had worked at three area hospitals over the last few years, including the facility operated by Bourgeois — was found dead in a vehicle pulled over along U.S. Highway 90 near Bayou Blue, police said.He apparently died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Police said a shotgun was used in all of the shootings.<i>With News Wire Services</i><a href=""mailto:jkemp@nydailynews.com""><i>jkemp@nydailynews.com</i></a><i><a href=""http://twitter.com/joekemp"" target=""_blank"">@joekemp</a></i>"

Additionally, he strangled his then-wife Denise Freeman, according to the Terrebonne sheriff’s office. Pixie’s husband Lafourche Councilman Phillip Gouaux, their daughter Andrea and Bouregois’ wife Anne were injured amid the killing spree, carried out at three locations.Denise Freeman was laid to rest in her native Mississippi last week. Bourgeois’ arrangements were not made public as of press time on Monday.Pixie Gouaux’s mass, which lasted approximately 90 minutes, was in line with the Catholic tradition. Phillip and Andrea Gouaux, still hospitalized in New Orleans with throat and back wounds, respectively, did not attend the public ceremony.“Be Not Afraid” and “On Eagle’s Wings,” as performed by Holy Savior’s choir, were the aural bookends. The gospel reading was from the Book of Matthew, 25:31, referred to as “The Final Judgment.” Its contents: Those who aid the hungry, who are welcoming to strangers, who clothe the naked and who visit the imprisoned will be awarded eternal life. And those who ignore the needy are ignoring Jesus, himself, and will suffer eternal punishment, as the reading goes.Eulogies were not given during mass – likely reserved instead for the private burial in the church cemetery that immediately followed – but the Rev. Robert C. Rodgers peppered his homily with remembrances of a woman he described as deeply involved in her community and her parish, a vital contributor to Lockport’s society irrespective of her husband’s elected position.Pixie, co-founder of the Bayou Lafourche Folklife and Heritage Museum, member of the Women’s Club of Lockport and Lion’s Club, and fundraiser, planner and teacher’s aide at Holy Savior, was sometimes seen in the school’s lounge with her glasses perched atop her head, awash in responsibilities and showing strain, but with no regard to shun other opportunities to give, he said. Pixie “liked to shop, sew and make things beautiful,” Rodgers remembered. That she and Phillip had fundamental differences in their passions – Phillip being a hunter and, generally, a man who “wants to live in the swamp” – is a testament to their overarching love for one another, the Gouauxes’ priest said.Rodgers also harped on the theme that faith should not be abandoned during times of great tragedy. Instead it should serve as a vehicle for resiliency, he said, as it can help shepherd a fragmented psyche through trying times. Local officials were scattered throughout the congregation, and few empty spaces remained. Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux Bishop Shelton Fabre attended the mass. Fabre mostly observed, though he participated in the blessing of communion and gave a brief address at the mass’ conclusion.Fabre talked about death. Specifically, he tackled three daunting perceptions of death – which he called fallacies. In the end, the bishop surmised, death is not proof that all walk through life alone, it is not a silencer of the spirit and it does not remove someone from existence, he said, acknowledging the mourners with a spread of his arms.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.

Both are from Slidell.Slidell Police Chief Randy Smith said Scott, who died at the scene
 of the shooting, was a target. Womack was an innocent bystander, Smith said.Slidell police say they've identified a potential suspect, but will not 
release any info yet citing ""sensitive nature of the investigation.""Authorities said gunshots rang out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday as the bars were closing. Slidell police said witnesses reported there was fighting near the intersection of First and Cousin streets and that during that altercation several gunshots were fired into the crowd.Adam Cannon, 27, said he was with friends at one of the area's bars, Shooters, and headed outside when the bar closed. He said there had been a few altercations inside the bar during the night and that they started up again outside in the street. Cannon said there were a lot of people outside the bar.""Everything was moving so fast. I heard gunfire and took off,'' he said. ""I didn't see anything - I just heard the shots. I just kept running.''Cannon's good friend, Quinterol Jackson, was one of those hit by the gunfire. Jackson was struck in the stomach and leg, Cannon's mother, Valerie Cannon, said. Valerie Cannon said Jackson, who is so close to her she calls him her ""son,'' was was recovering at Interim LSU Public Hospital in New Orleans. Adam Cannon said he came to Jackson's aid after the gunfire.""He was bleeding,''  Adam Cannon said. ""I gave him my shirt to use to try and stop the bleeding. I stayed with him until they put him in the ambulance.''Adam Cannon said another friend was shot in the foot.Seuzeneau said authorities believe an ""ongoing feud"" was re-ignited inside one of the bars and at some point spilled out onto the street. Seuzeneau said police believe there was one shooter.The shooter fired several shots into a crowd, he said.The injured were taken to Ocshner Medical Center in Slidell, Slidell Memorial Hospital and to Interim LSU Public Hospital in New Orleans, Seuzeneau said.""We are confident we will find the person and or persons responsible for the shooting last night,"" he said Thursday morning.Police responded quickly, he said. The Slidell Police Department is on Third Street, about two blocks from the scene of the shooting.Nearly nine hours after the shooting, First Street remained an active crime scene. Yellow police tape blocked off the street for two blocks between Robert and Bouscaren. Yellow evidence cones were scattered in front of Shooters bar. A Bud Light bottle sat in the middle of the cones.Several Slidell police cars, as well as the department's crime scene investigation vans sat inside the tape.Several businesses in the area have surveillance cameras, and Seuzeneau said police are using that footage in their investigation.A woman who lives on Cousin Street about a block and a half blocks from the scene of the shooting said she didn't hear shots or police sirens early Thursday. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she has lived near the bar district in Old Towne for several years and that there never are problems.""I feel safe here,"" she said.Seuzeneau said police haven't encountered many issues in that area, other than an occasional bar fight.Closing time for bars in Slidell is 2 a.m., said Slidell City Councilman Lionel Hicks, whose council district includes the Olde Towne area. Hicks said the bars in the area, at least in recent years, have not generated a lot of complaints that he has heard.""Every now and then, but it's nothing out of the ordinary,'' Hicks said.Councilwoman Kim Harbison, whose at large district also includes Olde Towne, echoed that. She said she does not hear a lot of complaints from constituents about the bars in Olde Towne.""Some for noise, but that's with any bar,'' Harbison said.She said the shooting Thursday was troubling.""Slidell's always been a beautiful, wonderful town,'' Harbison said. ""We have never had a whole lot of trouble.''Adam Cannon said fights occasionally occur at Shooters, but that nothing ever has happened on the scale of Thursday.""This was a whole other level,'' he said.Check back with NOLA.com for more on this breaking story.<i>Reporter Bob Warren contributed to this report.</i>

            The Police said they expect to make more arrests of those who aided Chatman after the shooting. The shooting happened at the Shooters Social Club overnight after Christmas.Witnesses said there were several fights inside the bar earlier in the night, and when the violence moved outside near the intersection of First and Cousin streets, someone opened fire into the crowd. Police responded around 1:30 a.m. Thursday and found Errol Scott, 22, dead. Mark Womack, 23, died later at a hospital. Six others also were struck.Four of the six wounded have been released from area hospitals, Slidell police Chief Randy Smith said. Two others are still undergoing treatment.Smith said the dead men were not the intended targets, despite previous reports to the contrary. Chatman ""is cooperating with the police and feels remorse for what he's done,"" the chief told reporters.Police were aided by tips that poured into Crimestoppers, which had offered an award of up $7,500 for Chatman's arrest. The chief praised the fast work of investigators and tried to ease safety concerns of residents. ""Although we have experienced an increase in violent criminal activity, Slidell is still a very safe place,"" Smith said in a prepared statement. ""It always has been and always will be.""Chatman has And Chatman was due in court on Nov. 21 on charges stemming from a September shooting on West Edwards Street in Covington, but he did not show up. He was wanted for skipping that court date at the time of this week's fatal shootings.He is being held on two counts of second-degree murder and six counts of attempted second-degree murder. He has not had his bond set. He'll appear before a court commissioner on Monday, a police spokesman said. <br/>

I'm not taking it well, not at all.""Montgomery Police Department detectives determined that the shooting stemmed from an ongoing dispute between McWilliams and Thomas.Montgomery officials have closed the nightclub, and the Alabama Beverage Control Board has pulled its liquor license, citing threats to public safety.The business previously operated as Rose Supper Club but was closed about a year ago following another shooting with six injuries. ""Guns don't kill people,"" the Rev. Ed Nettles, pastor of Freewill Missionary Baptist Church, said at the vigil. ""Buildings don't kill people, locations don't kill people. People kill people.

In addition to Thomas, Kimberle Johnson and Timnorious Hamilton were also fatally wounded in the shooting.Jason McWilliams and Darius Thomas, both 26, were later arrested and charged with three counts of capital murder in the case. The case was turned over to a grand jury in January 2014, but no decision has come down on whether to indict them or not.""The only thing that I can say at this point is that through discovery, there is still a lot of investigation that is taking place and new defendants are being discovered, which will be added to the complaint,"" Strickland said.Other people who were injured in the shooting have also filed complaints against the city, including the estates of Johnson and Hamilton, as well as Richard Davis, who was injured in the shooting.However, Frank Wilson, attorney for Johnson's family, said that with the ongoing capital murder case, his lawsuit would have to wait.""Here, we have a capital murder case, so in my mind, the case is pretty much on hold, pending some determination in that criminal case,"" Wilson said.In response to the shooting, the city shut down Centennial Hill last January.Zachary Collins, attorney for Davis and Hamilton's family, was not immediately available for comment Thursday, as well as Montgomery City Attorney Kim Fehl."

			Trending:		A bullet-riddled car remains at the scene where two men were wounded in a deputy-involved shooting at El Toro Road and Van Meter Street in an unincorporated county area near Duarte on Sunday.Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials investigate the scene where two men were wounded in a deputy-involved shooting at El Toro Road and Van Meter Street in an unincorporated county area near Duarte on Sunday.Neighbors watch Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials investigate the scene of deputy-involved shooting at El Toro Road and Van Meter Street in an unincorporated county area near Duarte on SundayLos Angeles County sheriff’s officials investigate the scene of a deputy-involved shooting at El Toro Road and Van Meter Street in an unincorporated county area near Duarte on SundayDeputies shot and wounded two men, one of whom was allegedly armed, following a brief car chase early Sunday near a Duarte neighborhood, authorities said.Both suspects, described as a 24-year-old man and a 36-year-old man, were expected to survive the injuries suffered in the 1:20 a.m. shooting at El Toro Road and Van Meter Street in an unincorporated county area just outside of Duarte, Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials said.The incident began when sheriff’s gang detectives, who have increased their presence in the area in recent weeks in response to a spate of shootings, spotted a man with a gun at Ivory Drive and Galen Street at the south end of Duarte, sheriff’s officials said in a written statement.The man got into a nearby car, which drove away, officials said. The detectives began chasing the car.“The pursuit, which lasted for approximately 30 seconds, ended when the vehicle collided with a curb at the 2400 block of El Toro Road (in an unincorporated county area),” according to Lt. Dave Dolson of the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau.“One of two suspects brandished a firearm, which resulted in a deputy-involved shooting,” Dolson said. No deputies were hurt, he said. “A weapon believed to be the suspect’s was recovered at the scene.”Further details, including the identities of the suspects, the number of deputies involved in the shooting or the number of shots fired were not released Sunday.A black Nissan Altima at the scene was riddled with more than two-dozen bullet holes. A dozen bullet holes were visible in the car’s rear windshield, and more than a dozen more dotted the driver-side of the car, with at least four through the driver-side window.Neighbor Roger Villarreal, 29, said he was awakened by gunfire. He and other neighbors described hearing “more than 25” shots.He said he dropped to the floor and pulled his fiancee to the floor as well as the shots continued ringing out.“I heard commands after the gunfire,” he said. Deputies shouted at the men inside the car to exit the vehicle and show their hands.One deputy yelled, “Where’s the (expletive) gun?” Villarreal said.The driver crawled out of the car before being dragged and handcuffed by deputies, he said. He did not see whether the second man exited the car following the shooting.Villarreal and his brother, Robert Villareal, 31, both said they saw deputies remove what appeared to be an automatic machine pistol, resembling a MAC-10, from the suspects’ car.Rovert Villarreal added he was thankful no bystanders were injured with so many bullets flying in the residential neighborhood.The investigation was being spearheaded by detectives from the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau, and anyone with information can reach the bureau at 323-890-5500.Get the latest news delivered daily!"

747,496684,"Five men heading to a party in Brooklyn were shot and a woman apparently was pistol-whipped, police and a community advocate said Tuesday, marking a year-end outburst of violence in a neighborhood that has struggled with crime even as it hit record lows.Police were looking for a suspect or suspects in the gunfire, which erupted just after midnight at a building in the Howard Houses public housing complex in Brownsville.Residents of a sixth-floor apartment had organized a party and put the word out on Facebook, said Tony Herbert, a community activist who said he had spoken to some of the guests and those injured. Some people who'd had previous conflicts with the party crowd showed up outside the Glenmore Avenue building, and bullets flew in the lobby as the teenage victims tried to run back inside, Herbert said.Some residents heard two quick shots, then several more, he said.The injured were taken to hospitals, the men with wounds to their legs and feet and the woman with cuts to her head, according to police and firefighters, who didn't release the patients' names. Police said all were expected to survive.The woman was in ""excruciating pain,"" said Herbert, who didn't have the full names of those injured. He planned to gather with other community advocates Tuesday morning to call for calm.""Our concern is that the attitude, with these young people, is that this may now be an occasion for retaliation,"" he said by phone. ""We're going to try to keep the peace.""Brownsville has one the city's highest concentrations of public housing developments. Groups of youths in one housing complex sometimes have ongoing feuds with their neighbors in another, Herbert said.In Brownsville, major crime hasn't declined as steeply as it has in some other parts of the city in the last 12 years. Serious crime dropped 30 percent citywide from 2002 to 2012, compared with 9 percent in Brownsville.Killings citywide are down more than 20 percent, to a record-low 333 so far this year, compared with last year. Brownsville also has recorded a new low — 14, two fewer than in 2012.The bloodshed in Brownsville this year has included a stray bullet hitting a baby boy in the head and killing him as he sat in his stroller in September; the February wounding of an armed 16-year-old by police officers responding to a report of shots fired on a rooftop; a drive-by shooting in July that left six people on the sidewalk wounded; and the unsolved killing in November of a man by a gunman driving near a public school."
748,496684,"A lone gunman shot five Brooklyn gang members and pistol-whipped a teen girl early Tuesday as they headed to a raucous Brooklyn housing project party, police said.The victims were waiting for an elevator at 60 Glenmore Ave. in the Howard Houses when the ski-masked shooter appeared at 12:10 a.m. and blasted into the young crowd, police said.""It was scary,"" said neighbor Khadjah Slaughter, 33, who saw blood all over the hallway floor. ""I'm going to move.""A neighborhood activist said the victims were apparently part of a dispute between rival crews from two housing projects.But victim William Holmes, walking with a cane after he was shot in the right calf and left ankle, said the gunfire began without warning.""The guy just ran up with a ski mask and started shooting,"" said the 16-year-old Frontier High School freshman. ""He was shooting at a bunch of us. He was trying to get all of us.""The mother of victim Giovanie Mayo, 18, said her son told her that the gunman was lying in wait for the teen revelers gathered in the building lobby.""He was hiding and came out of nowhere and shot,"" said Monet Mayor, 45. ""The gang people need to go. They all need to do hard time.""Cops recovered 9-mm. casings from the blood-spattered lobby, and said the five shooting victims were members of the ""Young Guns Gang,"" a police source said.The shooter, dressed in dark clothes, fled the Brownsville building and left his bullet-riddled victims bleeding in the lobby. He remained on the lam hours after the shootings.The victims — all hit below the waist — had just arrived to attend the sixth-floor party, which was advertised on Facebook.The pistol-whipped girl, whose name was not released, was 17.The gunshot victims were all Brooklyn males: William Holmes and Jayquan Williams, both 16 and shot in the foot; Giovanie Mayo, 18, shot in the toe, and Devon James, 18, shot in the thigh; and Sharise Randall, 19, shot in the thigh, cops said.Tony Herbert, a Brooklyn representative for the National Action Network, said he was worried about the possibility of retaliation over the shootings.""To me, it's all just stupidity,"" he said. ""They need to understand that you've got to let go so we can move our community forward.""Slaughter, the mother of two kids, said she called 311 with a noise complaint about the party just before the gunfire started.She was hospitalized with a heart arrhythmia after the shootings.""This never happened before,"" she said. ""I've lived here since I was 12. I've never had an experience with them shooting inside the building.""<em><a href=""mailto:bpaddock@nydailynews.com"">bpaddock@nydailynews.com</a></em>"

            By MUSKEGON, MI – Celebratory gunfire on Wednesday, New Year’s Day, resulted in at least one Muskegon home damaged by a stray bullet, police said.Celebratory gunfire -- Nearly every year someone in the Muskegon area reports property damage or personal injury during that time, authorities say.This year, on Jan. 1 around 12:15 a.m. in the 300 block of Monroe Avenue in Muskegon, a woman reported that her second-story window of her home was shot out.Officers recovered a spent 9 millimeter bullet in the residence.Police said there was a “high volume” of gunshots fired at midnight in that area, so it was difficult to determine the source of that bullet.No suspects were identified.Authorities have said in the past that A bullet fired into the air can climb up to two miles. When it falls back to earth, it can reach a speed of 300 to 700 feet per second. A velocity of only 200 feet per second is sufficient to penetrate the human skull, according to the Muskegon County Sheriff’s Office.<em>Heather Lynn Peters covers

Officers responded to a house on 113th Avenue between Sutphin Boulevard and 155th Street early New Year’s Day and found Julio Mora, 22, who had been in a physical altercation and was shot, a spokeswoman for the NYPD said. Emergency responders were called at about 1:15 a.m. and pronounced Mora dead at the scene.  Police initially said Mora had been stabbed, but the city’s medical examiner determined the 22-year-old ‘s cause of death was a gunshot wound, according to cops.On Thursday afternoon, police said 26-year-old Sheldon Smith was being sought by the NYPD in connection with Mora’s death. A spokeswoman for the NYPD would not specify if he was a suspect in the murder. Relatives said Mora lost his life exactly 19 years after his mother died unexpectedly.“It was the same day - January 1st,” said Mora’s grandfather, Carmelo Sanchez, who raised Mora and his older sister with his wife in Richmond Hill. “It hit home hard.”Sanchez said Mora’s mother, Rosalina LaSalle, died of a heart attack at age 24.Mora’s sister, Natasha Gibson, said that after their mother’s death she and her brother became very close, and he was living with her, her husband and her two sons, ages 8 and 6, at the time he was killed.“He went to school. He did his thing, and he was a pretty good boy,” Sanchez said.Mora graduated from John Bowne High School several years ago and had been doing odd jobs but most recently worked as a promoter for Smoke Liqueur, a pre-made cocktail made with vodka, his sister said. Gibson said the family spent Christmas together with their grandparents.“[Mora] was laughing and just joking around and just being himself,” she said.She spoke to him the following day, Dec. 26, and found out later that Mora had attended a house party at the South Jamaica house New Year’s Eve.“A lot of people were at this party,” she said. “He had gotten into an altercation with an older man, who left, and supposedly he came back.”One neighbor on 113th Avenue, who said young men often hung out in front of the home, said he was home early New Year’s Day when the murder took place.“I heard something before I went to bed, but I thought it was fireworks,” he said, while sweeping snow from his driveway Thursday morning,Gibson said her family is looking for more answers about how Mora died.“We want [a suspect] to be caught but more so we want to know what happened,” she said.Gibson said the family was still making funeral arrangements Thursday morning, but the cemetery had already been decided.“He will be buried in New Jersey with my mother,” she said.Reach managing editor Christina Santucci by e-mail at ©2014 Community News GroupGet our stories in your inbox, free.<input class=""theEmailBlastInput"" id=""theEmailBlastInput"" name=""email"" onfocus=""if(this.value=='Email')this.value='';"" type=""text"" value=""Email""/>Like TimesLedger on Facebook.By submitting this comment, you agree to the following terms:You agree that you, and not TimesLedger.com or its affiliates, are fully responsible for the content that you post.

He is making gun owners look bad.What an idiot.can you imagine?Wow aren’t we quick to criticize and judge. Lets think about this for a sec. The article has a little over two paragraphs. They don’t have even the guys name or model of gun. Maybe just maybe its not this guy that makes gun owners look bad but the media that thinks they need to cover every little incident that happens with a gun. Like the article posted on stgnews that made a big deal over a gun being spotted on someone and a 22 magazine found at the temple visitor center. All because a gun was invaled or mentioned. Kinda silly isn’t it?I was just about to say the same thing. Many comments in the STG News are made by folks who didn’t even read the article or just fired off some comment because of two or three key words mentioned in the title of the article.It doesn’t matter what his name is or the make and model of the gun. He is an idiot for not making sure it was unloaded BEFORE attempting to disassemble it. That is  a very basic gun handling and  safety procedure. Imagine if he had shot a child while practicing his idiocy. We would be having a very different conversation. Thankfully, he only hurt himself. Maybe the next time some common sense will come along and slap him upside his head.Really, having your pistol discharge while you’re trying to take it apart makes you an idiot.  Period.  I can base this on two things, never try to take a gun apart while a shell is in the chamber. AND never point a gun at anything, including your own Hand, you don’t have the intention of shooting.There is no way you can have an “accidental discharge” from a fire arm if you are practicing the most basic of safety.  I worked with a deputy in California that killed a copy machine due to a momentary lapse of basic safety precautions.  (Of course he made Lieutenant before he retired, but that’s another story.)“Accidents happen!”  Baloney.  “Stupidity and Carelessness Happen,” would be a more appropriate term.wowHis hand wound was on bestgore not that long ago.You must be This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

797,92328,"Phoenix man accused of murdering son with axSee photos from the scene in TollesonTwo sisters were found dead in a Tolleson home on Wednesday after police said they were slain by their father in a murder-suicide. Meanwhile, police in Phoenix arrested a father on suspicion of first-degree murder. Authorities said they believe he killedThe tragic deaths combined to send the Valley violently into the new year.The scene in Tolleson was discovered by a teenager who visited the home of relatives on Wednesday morning and found a man and his 6- and 8-year-old daughters dead inside.Two men who were working at a nearby church and food bank said they knew that something awful had happened, and that it was too late to help when they spotted the teenager on the front porch, wailing in agony.“It was terrified screaming. She was screaming in Spanish, over and over again,” said Steve Haltom, who works at the Bridge Community Church and Tolleson Food Bank.Dennis Sims, who also works at the food bank, said he wished there was something he could have done to help the teen. He said an older woman quickly arrived and appeared to take control.“People were devastated by what happened,” Sims said.Tolleson police were called at about 10 a.m. Wednesday and found the bodies.Authorities obtained a search warrant after a delay of several hours because of difficulties in locating a judge on New Year’s Day, according to Sgt. Obed Gaytan, a Tolleson police spokesman.He said detectives concluded that Alejandro Gallardo, 45, shot his daughters to death before turning a handgun on himself. Gallardo shot himself in the head, and the gun was found near his body, Gaytan said. The names of the girls were not released.“That is the grand question: Why?” Gaytan said.He said the timing was jarring, with police having the sad duty of notifying relatives who arrived at the scene.“It is very somber,” Gaytan said. “This is a time when we should be rejoicing with our family. It’s sad this sort of incident happened.”Neighbors said that there had been arguments between Gallardo and his girlfriend, the children’s mother, and that their relationship was breaking apart.The neighbors grieved the children’s deaths.“I just saw them out here playing (on Tuesday),” neighbor Cynthia Echeverria said. “To hear about what happened today was mind-blowing.”Maria Garza, another neighbor, broke into tears when she heard the news and said through an interpreter that the slain children had played with her children on Tuesday night.Neighbor Guadalupe Medina said Gallardo was a nice guy who invited neighbors to parties and worked at a nearby warehouse that packages carrots. She said Gallardo had told people that he planned to kill himself because the relationship with his girlfriend was broken but that no one took his statement seriously.“He never said that he was going to do that to the little girls,” Medina said. “I think he loved them a lot, so he took them with him.”The Tolleson slayings followed the death of David Sherrill, 13, in Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon.Police arrested his father, Gary Sherrill, 51, on suspicion of first-degree murder, said Sgt. Steve Martos, a Phoenix police spokesman.The father told police he was afraid of his son.“(He) stated he was scared of his son and believed his son was a demon and was going to eat him,” Martos said.David’s mother asked police to check on her son on Tuesday because her ex-husband was late returning the teen and she hadn’t been able to reach either of them, Martos said.At about 3:45 p.m. Tuesday, police conducted a welfare check on Gary Sherrill’s residence, in the 6000 block of North 10th Place, Martos said.Sherrill at first told officers that his son wasn’t home, but officers prodded him into inviting them inside.“Once inside, they located the 13-year-old male victim, David Sherrill, deceased with obvious signs of trauma,” Martos said. “Sadly, the victim sustained stab wounds and lacerations to several parts of his body.”Get azcentral.com on your phones and tablets for the latest news, sports, video, photos and much more from azcentral, The Arizona Republic and 12 News.<strong>» <a href=""http://mobile.azcentral.com/"">Get azcentral.com mobile!</a></strong>Download your free copy of Total Kid, an interactive digital parenting magazine filled with trending health topics, videos, tips and activities.

800,92345,"By A Seattle man accused of punching a woman and a man during a New Year’s brawl outside a Georgetown motorcycle club has been charged with assault.King County prosecutors contend Patrick Lee Gillum punched one man and “cold-cocked” a woman during a brawl outside the Magic Wheels Motorcycle Club on Jan. 1. Arrested at a Seattle hospital – his girlfriend was hit by a truck during the fight – Gillum is also alleged to have pointed a pistol at another man at the club.Police say Gillum, 29, is suspected of shooting the man who rammed his girlfriend. As no witnesses have identified him as the shooter, though, he has not been charged in that assault.Chaos broke out at the club shortly after 5 a.m. on New Year’s Day. Police were called to the club, located at 925 S. Doris St., following reports of a “large group fight” that turned into a shooting.According to charging papers, two women began arguing as the club emptied following a New Year’s party. The argument turned physical, and a man was viciously stomped by 10 or so others.Writing the court, a Seattle detective said Gillum punched the man and was among those who stomped on the man, breaking his ankle and jaw.During the fight, Gillum also punched a woman in the head, knocking her out, the detective continued. Most of the witnesses told police they couldn’t identify anyone involved in the fight.Gillum arrived at Harborview Medical Center, having driven his girlfriend there after she was struck by a truck outside the Magic Wheels clubhouse. Gillum’s girlfriend suffered a broken pelvis and other injuries.The woman Gillum is accused of punching out arrived at the First Hill hospital shortly thereafter, accompanied by her boyfriend. As it turned out, the woman’s jaw had been broken, and she suffered a deep cut on her scalp.According to charging papers, the man identified Gillum as his girlfriend’s assailant and told police Gillum punched her for no reason. The man said he doubted his still-unconscious girlfriend would be able to identify the man who “cold-cocked” her.“She wasn’t looking at him when he hit her,” the detective told the court, “and then (she) ‘went down like a sack of potatoes.’”The man went on to claim Gillum – a felon, not able to legally possess firearms – pointed a pistol at him when he attempted to defend his girlfriend, the detective told the court.The detective went on to say the stomped man said Gillum punched him in the head. The man couldn’t say whether Gillum was in the crowd that later stomped on him.Writing the court, the detective noted that the man who hit Gillum’s girlfriend was shot immediately after the crash. She said no witnesses have reported seeing Gillum shoot the driver, and that the investigation continues.Gillum has been charged with three counts of second-degree assault. He was released from jail after posting bond on $100,000 bail.Check the <strong>Seattlepi.com reporter Levi Pulkkinen can be reached at 206-448-8348 or </strong> "

802,92490,"Residents of the normally quiet Avalon Park community were struggling late Wednesday to understand how New Year's Eve could have ended with one of their neighbors dead and his 15-year-old son accused of killing him.Nelson Martinez, who lives next door to the single-family home on Sun Dew Drive where the deadly shooting happened, said victim Christopher Albano, 34, was a good neighbor and an attentive father to his two teenage sons and younger daughter.""It's such a shock because they were nice people,"" said Martinez, 29, a married father of one. ""It's just scary to wake up to — and on New Year's Day at that.""Orange County deputies say the 15-year-old, whose name has not been released, shot his dad about 2:20 a.m. Wednesday after the father came home drunk and hit his wife.Jinette Albano called 911 to report the shooting and told a dispatcher that her son had shot her husband, said Deputy Ginette Rodriguez, a sheriff's spokeswoman. There have been no arrests.Investigators have not provided details about where in the house the shooting happened or who was present, nor have they disclosed whether deputies had been called to the home before.Neighbors, however, said deputies had been summoned to the Albano home previously. The Sheriff's Office could not immediately confirm that.Paula Womick, 47, whose house backs up to the Albanos', said she and another neighbor called 911 about a year ago when she heard a gunshot. She said she looked out and saw Christopher Albano in his backyard holding a gun. His dog was with him.About a month ago, Womick said she saw Albano naked on his back porch about 1 a.m. doing karate moves and ""howling,"" she said. His wife came out and got him to come inside.Womick said Albano had a kind side. Once, he helped Womick take a relative's dog to an animal hospital after it had fallen into the family's pool.""He was very nice in that way,"" she said.The killing was the talk of the east Orange community, where TV news trucks parked for hours and the curious walked and drove past the house.""It's a quiet, safe neighborhood here,"" said Joanna Thompson, 57, as she walked her dog. ""It kind of frightens me that you never know what goes on behind closed doors.""The two boys attend Timber Creek High School, neighbors said.The Albanos bought their house in February 2008, Orange County Property Appraiser's records show. Bank of America filed a foreclosure lawsuit against the Albanos in August 2012. The action is pending.Relatives stopped by the house in the late afternoon to retrieve some belongings, but they would not comment. There was no sign from the outside that anything unusual had happened.A Christmas wreath hung on the front door, a snowman decoration was in a window, an American flag flew and a Virgin Mary statuette sat among the landscaping.A sign near the door read, ""Bless this home and all who enter.""<i><a href=""mailto:sjacobson@tribune.com"">sjacobson@tribune.com</a> or 407-540-5981</i>"

Police shone their flashlights as they scoured the area for the shooter, who apparently evaded authorities.Multiple shell casings were found in the roadway at the corner of Franklin and Genesee streets, where officers used small orange cones to mark where evidence of the shooting was located.More evidence was found at 449 Franklin St., a white, 2½-story residence at the corner of Franklin and Genesee. Officers could be seen interviewing occupants of the home and placing orange cones on its porch, which apparently was struck by gunfire. There were no reported injuries.Meanwhile, several officers remained back at the Liberty Street address, the site of the initial 1:56 a.m. disturbance call that triggered the large police response. A second 911 call related to the incident at 462 Liberty St. was received at 1:58 a.m., this time to report that someone had been shot. But investigating officers did not find any shooting victims, according to initial police reports from the scene. About 15 minutes later, gunfire erupted at 2:09 a.m. at the corner of Franklin and Genesee, which is only about 500 feet from the Liberty Street address. Early reports indicated a yellow vehicle was seen fleeing the area.Police were still actively investigating as of 3 a.m., and additional information was not immediately available.More details will be posted on MassLive as they become available. <strong><hr/>MAP showing locations of two different crime scenes in Lower Liberty Heights neighborhood: <br/>

817,92303,"MILWAUKEE (WITI) — The Milwaukee Police Department says an officer diffused a potentially dangerous situation and arrested an intoxicated man for pointing and aiming a gun. This happened around 12:45 pm on Wednesday, January 1st outside a business near Locust and Humboldt Blvd.The District 5 officer apparently told the suspect to drop the weapon, but the suspect initially refused. The officer was eventually able to safely recover the 9mm pistol from the suspect, a 34-year-old Milwaukee man, and take the suspect into custody.The suspect admitted to having been drinking since 7 p.m. the night before. A breathalyzer test revealed his Blood Alcohol Content was .22 — nearly three times the legal limit for driving.The suspect faces several charges including Aggravated Assault-Pointing and Aiming a Firearm. The case will be referred to the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office.<strong>Filed in:</strong><strong>Topics:</strong><p>Uncovering school bus violations, a FOX6 Investigation.</p>Uncovering school bus violations, a FOX6 Investigation.

A Merced family woke up to an alarming discovery on New Year’s Day: a dead man in their backyard.It appears the unidentified man in his 20s was shot to death, said Merced police Sgt. Scott Skinner. Police went to the scene in the 1300 block of Derby Court just before 10 a.m. Wednesday after being called by the residents of the home.“The homeowners have no idea who this individual is,” Skinner said, adding the police investigation is in its early stages. “When they woke up this morning, they discovered a body ... of someone they don’t know.”Skinner said police received calls close to midnight on New Year’s Eve saying people were running around the neighborhood. He said police got calls shortly after about shots being fired. “With it being New Years, we had several shots fired throughout the city,” Skinner said. “We responded last night and didn’t see anything.”No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Police returned to the area nearly 10 hours later after receiving the phone call about the body in backyard. Neighbors Jose and Cristina Valencia, who live in the area,  said they heard loud banging sounds about 4:30 a.m. “It appears that he (the victim) was trying to jump over our fence,” said 37-year-old Cristina Valencia, describing the victim as a black man with red dreadlocks. “His knee is bloody and he was laying by the fence – you could tell he tried to jump over.”The circumstances leading up to the homicide are still unclear. Cristina Valencia’s father, 63-year-old Ray Ramirez, said he heard a bang followed by barking dogs. He woke up to three bullet holes in his bedroom, including one that went through the wall next to his bed. “If I had been standing next to the refrigerator, I’d be hit,” Ramirez said. “I just thought, ‘holy smokes, I could have not made it this morning.’ It’s a heck of a way to start the new year.”The Valencias described the area as a safe neighborhood, but said some problems occurred after a group of renters moved into a home on the street.Another next-door neighbor recently moved to the block and said he was shocked to wake up to a swarm of police cars on New Year’s Day.“In my line of work, I see that happening a lot but for me to see it happening next door is pretty scary,” said 27-year-old Manuel Mazon, who works for an alarm company. “In this case, it sounds like they were running for safety and got caught in a court and didn’t have anywhere to go.“I just feel sorry for the neighbors,” Mazon added, “and the family (of the victim) that has to be called.”The incident is Merced County’s first homicide of the year, according to Skinner.Police are asking anyone with information about the homicide to call Sgt. Scott Skinner at (209) 385-4702 or the department’s automated tipline at (209) 725-4125. Tips are kept confidential and you can remain anonymous.

A Columbus man got more than he bargained for after he threatened to burn his girlfriend's couch, drawing the attention of police, and then had to explain a found stash of weapons in the bedroom.Raeshaed Wineglass, 30, was in Columbus Recorder's Court Thursday on charges of arson and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.He pled not guilty to all charges.Wineglass had originally threatened the victim, his girlfriend, via text, saying that he would burn her couch over a dispute, according to police testimony. He then sent her a text showing that the couch was burning.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Officer Mark Neal responded at about 3 a.m. Wednesday to the victim's unit in the Booker T. Washington Apartments on 5th Avenue. Inside, officers saw that both the couch and loveseat had been burned and then apparently extinguished with water, according to Neal's testimony.When police found Wineglass in the bedroom, they also found a 10-round magazine, fully loaded, at his feet; and two pistols underneath the bed.Wineglass said that he didn't know the weapons were in the room, Neal testified. Wineglass' ex-girlfriend said that one of the guns had belonged to her previously, but that it had been stolen by Wineglass.Under questioning from Wineglass' public defense attorney, Neal made reference to Wineglass' ""19-page criminal history.""Judge Michael Joyner set a $5,000 bond for each count of arson and possession.

			Trending:		A 22-year-old man has been arrested for investigation of aggravated assault after he allegedly shot a girl in the hand shortly after midnight Wednesday on a Denver street, authorities say.The girl, described as being around 15,  was treated at a hospital with a non-life-threatening injury, said Sonny Jackson, Denver police spokesman.Walter Moore has been arrested in the shooting, Jackson said.“It could have been New Year’s Eve revelry,” he said. “But it doesn’t make a difference to us. It’s still aggravated assault.”The circumstances of the shooting on the 4200 block of Cook Street  are under investigation, Jackson said.“We don’t know why the gun went off,” he said. It could have been an accident, he added.“I don’t think he tried to shoot her,” Jackson said.The shooting was one of only a few incidents that happened in Denver over night, he said. “It was a typical night in the city on New Year’s,” Jackson said.<i>Kirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, <a href=""http://denverpost.com/coldcases"">denverpost.com/coldcases</a> or <a href=""http://twitter.com/kmitchelldp"">twitter.com/kmitchelldp</a></i>"

892,92307,"By A fatal shooting on New Year's Eve and a couple of nonfatal shootings concluded a violent year in Milwaukee in which more people were killed by assailants than in any since 2005.If the unofficial tally holds up, Milwaukee will have had 106 homicides in 2013, the largest number of such deaths in the tenure of Police Chief Edward A. Flynn, who was hired more than five years ago.Police have released few details of Tuesday's fatal shooting. A man was found on the street in the 7400 block of W. Appleton Ave. No one had been arrested Wednesday in that death, a department spokesman said.Two other people were shot in separate cases Tuesday night, and two nonfatal shootings happened in the early hours of Wednesday.An arrest was made in one of Tuesday's shootings and one of the shootings Wednesday morning.Much of the last year's violence occurred in August, which saw 20 homicides. That month also had the third-highest monthly number of nonfatal shootings — 78 — since the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission began keeping those records in 2006.The violence spilled over into September, when 14 more homicides were recorded.The 2013 homicide data is preliminary, and numbers could fluctuate because several death investigations are continuing. The Milwaukee Police Department follows the FBI's national crime reporting standards, which use the date of an individual's death in crime statistics and do not include homicides ruled self-defense.Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Milwaukee regularly had more than 100 homicides a year, with a high of 165 such deaths in 1991, according to those FBI standards. That pattern dropped significantly starting in 2008, the year Flynn took office.There have been four shootings since midday Tuesday that didn't involve life-threatening injuries. According to police:■ A man was shot about 8:20 p.m. Tuesday while in the 2700 block of W. Lincoln Ave., police said. No one has been arrested in that incident.■ A 22-year-old woman was shot by a family member about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday while in the 1600 block of S. 25th St. The woman and the family member were arguing. The woman was hospitalized and the family member was taken into custody.■ A 28-year-old Milwaukee man was shot by someone who knew him about 3:45 a.m. Wednesday while he was in the 4700 block of N. 50th St. The man drove himself to a friend's house, and the friend drove him to a hospital. Police later arrested one person and they're looking for others to arrest.■ A 33-year-old Milwaukee man was shot about 5:30 a.m. Wednesday while he was in the 1400 block of S. 11th St. He told police that he was in a confrontation with someone on the street but that he didn't know the person who shot him. He was taken to a hospital.<i>Ashley Luthern of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.</i>Sharif Durhams is the social media editor and a digital strategist for the newsroom.<a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime""><strong>More</strong></a><a href=""http://jsonline.com/homicides/""><img alt=""Milwaukee homicide database"" src=""/Services/image.ashx?domain=www.jsonline.com&amp;file=homicide_database_2.jpg&amp;resize="" style=""width:100%; height:auto;""/></a><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://jsonline.com/homicides/"">Search homicides</a> </span>"

The passenger in the vehicle, a 31-year-old was pulled out with serious injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening. The identities of the victims were not released, pending notification of their families.Not very surprisingly, alcohol as well as the car’s speed were factors in causing the accident, according to police.But that wasn’t even the first incident in a New Year’s Day of chaos in the city of about 180,000 in southeast Virginia.At 12:22 am police responded to a call saying a child had been shot on the 1100 block of 27th Street. The cops arrived to find The boy’s mother told police that her son was struck by a stray bullet, though from where was not determined.In a separate New Year’s Day incident, about 40 minutes after the wounding of the 6-year-old, a disturbance in the P.U.R. LUX nightclub at 11975 Jefferson Avenue spilled out into the club’s parking lot — and erupted into gunfire. When police showed up, they found a 20-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the posterior. They also found that bullets hit several parked cars.Then, at about 1:30 am, police were responding to another report of gunfire near Circuit and Deputy lanes when the police car was hit by a bullet in the passenger’s side door. The officer in the car was not hurt.Finally, there was a robbery at 6:20 am on the morning of New Year’s Day. A 24-year-old man was shot in the thigh by two men who stole his wallet and some other possessions. Again, the injury he suffered was considered survivable, according to the All content © 2008

915,92309,"By A fatal shooting on New Year's Eve and a couple of nonfatal shootings concluded a violent year in Milwaukee in which more people were killed by assailants than in any since 2005.If the unofficial tally holds up, Milwaukee will have had 106 homicides in 2013, the largest number of such deaths in the tenure of Police Chief Edward A. Flynn, who was hired more than five years ago.Police have released few details of Tuesday's fatal shooting. A man was found on the street in the 7400 block of W. Appleton Ave. No one had been arrested Wednesday in that death, a department spokesman said.Two other people were shot in separate cases Tuesday night, and two nonfatal shootings happened in the early hours of Wednesday.An arrest was made in one of Tuesday's shootings and one of the shootings Wednesday morning.Much of the last year's violence occurred in August, which saw 20 homicides. That month also had the third-highest monthly number of nonfatal shootings — 78 — since the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission began keeping those records in 2006.The violence spilled over into September, when 14 more homicides were recorded.The 2013 homicide data is preliminary, and numbers could fluctuate because several death investigations are continuing. The Milwaukee Police Department follows the FBI's national crime reporting standards, which use the date of an individual's death in crime statistics and do not include homicides ruled self-defense.Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Milwaukee regularly had more than 100 homicides a year, with a high of 165 such deaths in 1991, according to those FBI standards. That pattern dropped significantly starting in 2008, the year Flynn took office.There have been four shootings since midday Tuesday that didn't involve life-threatening injuries. According to police:■ A man was shot about 8:20 p.m. Tuesday while in the 2700 block of W. Lincoln Ave., police said. No one has been arrested in that incident.■ A 22-year-old woman was shot by a family member about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday while in the 1600 block of S. 25th St. The woman and the family member were arguing. The woman was hospitalized and the family member was taken into custody.■ A 28-year-old Milwaukee man was shot by someone who knew him about 3:45 a.m. Wednesday while he was in the 4700 block of N. 50th St. The man drove himself to a friend's house, and the friend drove him to a hospital. Police later arrested one person and they're looking for others to arrest.■ A 33-year-old Milwaukee man was shot about 5:30 a.m. Wednesday while he was in the 1400 block of S. 11th St. He told police that he was in a confrontation with someone on the street but that he didn't know the person who shot him. He was taken to a hospital.<i>Ashley Luthern of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.</i>Sharif Durhams is the social media editor and a digital strategist for the newsroom.<a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime""><strong>More</strong></a><a href=""http://jsonline.com/homicides/""><img alt=""Milwaukee homicide database"" src=""/Services/image.ashx?domain=www.jsonline.com&amp;file=homicide_database_2.jpg&amp;resize="" style=""width:100%; height:auto;""/></a><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://jsonline.com/homicides/"">Search homicides</a> </span>"

""They're unfortunate and they tend to cluster, so it doesn't mean we're going to get another six or seven or 10 in another month. Nonetheless, it's very, very concerning.""Shihadeh works alongside Baton Rouge Police and other agencies as part of the BRAVE initiative to bring down group violence in Baton Rouge. While street crime and gang activity has decreased, he says domestic violence is a whole different animal.""Those [incidents] are extremely hard to predict, extremely hard to prevent. They're not out in the open. They tend to take place behind closed doors. There is a general recognition even among people in BRAVE that it's time to start looking at domestic violence,"" he said.Shihadeh says while there are some outreach programs in the area, more must be done to bring down Louisiana's alarming rates of domestic violence.""One thing that would help tremendously is to have more outreach,"" he said. ""Not cut funding to shelters, to have places where women can go, where children can go, and to set up a system of reporting like we've done with BRAVE. A system for people to say 'Look there's violence in my family,' and where there can be some kind of intervention.""<em>Copyright 2014 </em> 844 Government Street"

            By TRENTON – A city woman has the dubious distinction of being Trenton’s first shooting victim of 2014 when she was shot outside a South Ward restaurant early this morning, police said.It was not immediately clear whether the gunshot wound she received to the upper rib area was life-threatening, but the woman was conscious and alert when she was being taken to a city hospital, Lt. Mark Kieffer said.The woman, whose age was not available, was on the 800 block of Lamberton Street around 1 a.m. when a man in dark clothing fired a gun at her, Kieffer said. At least one bullet struck the woman.Police were called out, and an ambulance took the victim to Capital Health Regional Medical Center for treatment. Detectives are investigating and trying to determine a motive in the case.No other shootings were reported New Year’s Eve 2013 into the early hours of New Year’s Day in the capital city, Kieffer said. In 2013, Trenton took just 45 minutes to record New Jersey’s first homicide of the year with the shooting death of James Threadgill.A full description of the suspect in today’s shooting was not available. Anyone with information on the crime should call police at (609) 989-4170, or the Confidential Tip Line at (609) 989-3663.On mobile or desktop:• Like • Follow

958,95273,"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.– An woman on the east side of Indianapolis says she thanks God for protecting her from harm after a stray bullet crashed through her window and struck her in the back.Rachel Stevenson, 39, had just returned home to her apartment near East 38th Street and Franklin Road after attending a late New Year’s Eve church service. She had just closed her bible and was sitting on the edge of her bed praying before going to sleep.“The next thing you know, I just hear a big pow,” Stevenson said.The noise was a bullet, crashing through her bedroom window. It ricocheted off her ceiling and hit her in the middle of her back, bouncing off without leaving a scrape or bruise.She says police who responded to her 911 call examined the bullet, then said she should hold on to the “good luck bullet.”But Rachel thinks it was more than luck.“Maybe some people may not believe it but, I know for myself that that was nothing but God,” she said.Despite Rachel’s story of survival, the incident represents a troubling tradition police and neighborhood leaders would like to do without. Despite the urging of Indianapolis Metropolitan Police, Stevenson’s neighbors tell Fox59 they heard multiple gunshots around the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Day.There were no reports of any serious injuries from stray bullets Wednesday morning. But Rachel Stevenson says her close call should serve as a warning against celebrating with gunfire. For now, she has moved her mattress into her living room. She’s afraid to sleep in her bedroom.“Because I could have been shot dead, or in the hospital paralyzed and I got kids.”<strong>Filed in:</strong><strong>Topics:</strong>

990,92883,"A firearm was brandished by the individual, who refused to drop the firearm. The officer fired his duty weapon.A member of the Fort Walton Beach Police Department was involved Sunday in the area’s first fatal officer-involved shooting in more than two years.
While little information has been released, FWBPD has confirmed that a man died following a confrontation with a department officer.
According to a news release from FWBPD, early Sunday morning an officer responded to a repeat call concerning loud noise. The officer arrived and made contact with the individual about the complaint.
A firearm was brandished by the individual, who refused to drop it, the report said. The officer then fired his duty weapon. The individual was transported to Fort Walton Beach Medical Center Emergency Room where he was pronounced dead.
The officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave until the completion of a preliminary investigation. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting the investigation into the shooting.
The name, age and residence of the person killed, the name of the officer involved, the type of weapon possessed by the deceased, plus the location and time of the incident were not released by either FDLE or Fort Walton Beach Police.
According to Daily News archives, the incident early Sunday morning is the first officer-involved shooting locally that resulted in a death since one man was killed and two police officers were wounded on Jan. 2, 2014, during a shootout at a home on Savage Street in Crestview.
Officer Beau Baier was shot in the left thigh and Officer Shane Kriser took a bullet just above the right knee when they entered the home during that deadly encounter at 462 N. Savage St. Killed in the shootout was 33-year-old Rasheik Calhoun.
The Crestview Police Department’s SWAT team had gone to the home on Savage Street to serve a search warrant for Calhoun and his brother, Yoni Calhoun, 27. Both from Alabama, the brothers were wanted on multiple charges including armed robbery, aggravated battery with a firearm and firing a deadly missile into a vehicle or dwelling, according to police records.
Upon arrival, gunfire was exchanged as Kriser, Baier and at least one other SWAT team member entered the home. It was confirmed later in Daily News accounts of the incident that five youngsters, four adult men and two adult women were at the residence when police went in about 10:45 p.m. on a Thursday night in early January 2014.
Aphrey Benjamin Collis, 38, was arrested at the scene and charged with two counts of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. Crestview Police Chief Tony Taylor reported a 9 mm revolver was among the weapons found at the scene.
Yoni Calhoun was not at the residence when the SWAT team arrived, but later surrendered to authorities in Union Springs, Alabama, on Jan. 12.
Police began investigating Collis and the Calhoun brothers about three weeks prior to the shooting after a pistol whipping incident, Taylor said. Shots were fired, but no one was injured.
The search warrant was executed several hours after a woman told police she was shot in the leg in an alley. Police at the time reported they believed the incidents were connected.

996,92817,"MORGAN COUNTY, Ala. (WHNT) - A murder arrest in a Morgan County Homicide.Morgan County Sheriff Ana Franklin says Compton and Bowling were at a mobile home where people were cooking and using meth.Here is a map of where the shooting took place.<strong>Filed in:</strong>I am Johnathan’s first cousin. I’d really like to THANK YOU ALL for announcing my cousin’s name and information on television BEFORE we, his family, could get in touch with his son, his mother, and his brother.Hell he killed a guy what do you exspect? Your probably a big METH head too!It was extremely inconsiderate to release his name on public television before immediate family members, especially his son, could be notified. It is painful enough for families to suffer such loss, without this kind of exploitation. I feel this is definitely a breach of privacy.When a murderer is running from the law the police or the news don’t care about notifying next of kin…that only happens with the victim!!!!! If someone murdered your family member you would want the police looking for the person of interest immediately!!!!!!!!!! He lost His rights to privacy when he decided to MURDER another human being!She’s referring to the family of the victim not being properly notified, not the suspect’s family.Jana, we are sorry for your family’s loss.  The Sheriff’s Office at first asked us to withhold the name while family was notified. We did – we always respect that request. The Sheriff’s Office called us later in the night, overnight, and said the name could be released, so we reported it in our morning news on Friday.  Again, we are very sorry for your family’s loss.NO LET US GO AFTER THE METH HEAD that caused this death. Dudes on this drug feel invisible to anything. But its gon’ wear off, cody. we gon’ put you  in that 8 by 12 with nothing but a metal toilet and 6′ mattress and a worn out blanket. we want you to have one hour of recreation in a cage. oh yeah, lets see how meth wins with this one. in the meantime, no bond till trial and it takes 3 years! you gon’ see everyone bond out and you are just waiting to go to kilby or holman.To the Bowlings…so sorry for you senseless loss! I hope they catch him and he gets what he deserves. Meth has caused so much loss. Hope Anna finally wipes this mountain clean!!!!!!I HOPE YOU HAVE MORE HELP CLEANING UP THE DRUG PROBLEM THAN JUST DEPENDING ON “ANA” HOPE THIS COUNTY WAKES UP AND REALIZES THAT SHE ISN’T DOING A GOOD JOB AS SHERIFF. ALL SHE DOES IS TAKE TRIPS AND CALL THE MEDIA WHEN ONE OF HER DEPUTIES MAKES A TRAFFIC STOP ON A VEHICLE THAT MIGHT HAVE A 2 LITER BOTTLE IN IT. SHE ISN’T WORKING TO CLEAN THIS COUNTY UP, OTHER THAN CLEANING OUT THE SHERIFFS BANK ACCOUNT.I am so sorry for your loss. PrayersI knew cody growing up and this is not like him. He was always very very sweet to my recollection. Just goes to show what drugs can do. My condolences go out to BOTH families, for the loss of these individuals.  You all are in my prayers.I have no sympathy for meth heads, past or present. THEY RUIN LIVES OF CHILDREN with their poison and sometimes their own. Good riddance to both. Have you ever seen a newborn baby born addicted to meth. I have and it makes me wnat to make a deep woods wind chime out of the breeders of that poor baby.AMEN Douglas!Douglas, we have actually adopted 3 children from a meth home that were all born addicted to meth and other drugs. It left all 3 of them with different disabilities that they (the children) have to live with the rest of their lives. It is very sad how the children have to suffer from withdrawals and from the different disabilities. I lift all families involved up in prayer. Meth is a very sickening drug that destroys many lives. Prayers to all.My prayers go out to both families. But people need to realize that the law says its serve and protect and it’s also JUSTICE FOR ALL. NOT JUSTICE FOR SOME OR MOST. I also know that METH  can take over your lives and family and it makes you feel 6’O foot tall and bullet proof but the law also says if you do the crime then you must do the time. I’m not preaching just stating the facts.I went to school with Cody. Guy’s always beena  hood rat, always will be a hood rat.Your right kaycee.  All the public knows about ana is what they see on the tv and trust me thats the only time u see her.  She makes it a point to be on tv.  She is a politician not a sheriff.  Maybe the public will realize they are paying for trips to the beach for so called conventions she takes 2 – 3 times a year and takes her favorites butt kissing deputies with her.  Its election time and time fore her to go and all the over paid cronies she brought with her.Steven so glad someone else is seeing what is going on!! She has hired her buddies on the counties dime! Deputies who should be getting promotions are looked over because there isn’t room for them and her buds. She wastes OUR money on all these trips and on the K-9 unit (what county dept needs like 8 dogs??) and that flipping posse that doesn’t do anything but ride in parades. And she lied about that posse being at a training location when poor Mr. Payne was found in Lacey. The only searching they were doing at Rock Bridge Canyon was searching for the bottom of a beer can or wine bottle. Ridiculous, she is not qualified for the position as sheriff and I hope she gets beat in the next election. I hope people start doing some research and figure out that she is running this county in the ground. We are such a joke to other law enforcement agencies. Sad.No sympathies! Cody killed another human being and he deserves whatever is coming his way.Meth ain’t no excuse. These kids have no B***S  when it comes to dealing with any aspect of their lives! They can’t play ball anywhere, can barely read or write, much less form good friendships with people. They only need ‘something’ to give them courage to do what ‘normal’ people do over coffee! whatever issues the deceased had, no one has a right to take the life of another. yeah, see how it feels to sit in for 23 hrs,,eat pig food for lunch and dinner and have another pump your azzz. Bon Apetit, Cody.jonathan  was a very good friend of mine and he will always be missedComments are closed.

1003,92349,"An armed robber picked the wrong house in South Philly to target today, police said.The thug, armed with a shotgun, forced his way into a house on 7th Street near Shunk about 2 p.m., Chief Inspector Scott Small said.Two people home at the time of the break-in refused to give in to the robber's demands, and instead fought back, trying to wrestle the gun away from him.A shot was fired in the brawl, but no one was wounded, Small said.When police arrived on the scene, they found the robber a little roughed-up, apparently from his scuffle with the home's occupants. He's been taken into custody.Police have not released the identity of the suspect nor the home's occupants.

			Trending:		David Maldonado, a resident at Renaissance Apartments, takes down police tape outside his apartment after a man was shot and killed by police after a domestic violence call to the apartments, January, 03 2014. Wesley MaldonadoTHORNTON  —   Residents of a Thornton apartment complex where the driver of an SUV  was fatally shot by police overnight said multiple police officers fired more than a dozen shots at the  man who had led police on a long, high-speed chase. Officers were  called about 11:30 p.m. Thursday  to the 300 block of East 88th Avenue, the Renaissance 88 Apartments, on a domestic violence report  that included possible  gunfire at the residence, according to a Thornton Police Department media release. When officers arrived, a suspect was seen driving out of the  complex, police said. Officers pursued the driver to Denver and then back to the apartment  complex, where the incident concluded in the fatal shooting.  Several residents of the complex who witnessed the incident  took video on their cell phones and passed them along to police investigators. Some of those witnesses described the police response as excessive.“There were people out here walking around and they were shooting — boom, boom boom!” said LaVonne Rodriguez, 42, a resident. After multiple shots were fired, perhaps as many as 20, Rodriguez said, officers starting yelling at people to “get inside.” “It was unreal —  it was like the end of the world the way the cops were shooting,” Rodriguez said. She and other residents said Friday morning they were thankful   gunfire didn’t spray  a nearby  building. Residents said they know the man who was fatally shot and said he lived in the complex. Police identified him Friday afternoon as 35-year-old Wesley Maldonado. Sgt.  Matt Kandt, a Thornton Police Department spokesman, said one shot was fired at the residence during the alleged domestic violence incident. A second shot was fired by the suspect  some time during the 30-minute pursuit, but investigators aren’t certain when or where that happened, Kandt said. In the apartment parking lot, police said, the SUV appeared to intentionally hit two police cars. More than one officer said Maldonado pointed a firearm at officers as they approached the SUV, prompting four officers to open fire, Kandt said. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene; no one else was injured. Police said a gun that had recently been fired was found in his  vehicle.  Maldonado has a lengthy arrest record in the state, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation database. In October, he was arrested in Adams County on misdemeanor domestic violence. Maldonado was also arrested at least twice,  once in 2008 in Arvada and in 2009 in Jefferson County, on charges of possession of an illegal weapon. He pleaded guilty in the 2008 case and was sentenced to three years probation. A 2011 arrest in Denver included a habitual traffic offender charge and several arrests over the years were illegal  drug charges. Witnesses said Friday the man driving the SUV was gone less than  45 minutes   when he circled back. By that time, many residents had come out of their homes to inquire  about the initial incident. The witnesses said the driver  entered the 180-unit complex on the west end and sped through the parking lot. Resident Russell Schloss said he watched from a bedroom window as the SUV sped back toward East 88th Avenue and an  exit. “A Denver cop (car) rammed him and spun him out,” Schloss said. By that time the SUV was smoking, a tire, or tires, were shredded in the incident and sparks were flying from  the under carriage.  “He wasn’t going to get much further,” Schloss said. “He was going on rims.” Brad Jantz, 20, said he was in front of his building when he saw the SUV racing  through the lot leaving a trail of smoke. “It slammed into a cop car,” Jantz said. The collision was followed by shots, which sent Jantz scrambling for safety. “It was pretty crazy,” Jantz said. “There was so much smoke, you couldn’t seen 10  feet in front of you.” Another witness questioned the level of response.“It was just not right,” resident Harold McBride said of the shooting. “They (police) could have blocked him in.” Neighbors said a woman who lived with the man was extremely distraught after the incident and  was taken away from the complex by emergency responders. The  incident is being investigated by the Adams County Critical Incident Team. Anyone with any information on the case  is asked to call the Metro Area Crime Stoppers at 720 913-7867. "

1023,92904,"A 60-year-old man suffered a four-inch cut on his head early Thursday after another man hit him with a shotgun's handle during a robbery, Little Rock police said. Steven Montgomery of Little Rock told authorities that he was walking about 12:13 a.m. to his home, which is near the Kum & Go on Colonel Glenn Road, when a man stopped him with a shotgun, according to a Little Rock Police Department report.Montgomery told officers that the man pointed the gun at him and demanded, ""Give me all of your money,"" the report states. The robber stole about $20 in cash from Montgomery and then struck him on the back of his head with the shotgun's handle. Montgomery said the robber ran toward the gas station's back area. Authorities said Montgomery was taken to St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center to be treated for the gash that officials said would require staples or stitches.Police describe the robber as a black man, between 20 and 25 years old, standing 5-foot-6 and weighing about 170 pounds. He was last seen wearing all black clothing. It's always a smart idea to walk alone after midnight.

""It didn't go through his head, although sometimes people survive those too.""It started with a report of an aggravated assault about 11:30 a.m. at a home in the 8400 block of Herlong Road. Smith said Gary Robert Schiwart, 45, had gotten into an argument with his mother and was suicidal.""Apparently the mother was inside the residence, they got into an altercation and as she fled the residence, he fired a shot from a shotgun at her,"" Smith said. The woman wasn't hit.A little while later police received another call from Schiwart's concerned sister, Smith said. Just before 1 p.m. shots were fired in the house and the man inside threatened suicide and to kill anyone who approached.By 2:30 p.m. negotiators and SWAT members were set up and began several hours of contact with Schiwart by phone and bullhorn.Shortly after 4 p.m. police heard another gunshot, and Schiwart broke out a window and fired a blast at a SWAT response vehicle with several officers inside. Police fired back, Smith said. Schiwart retreated then reappeared just before 5 p.m. at the front door with the shotgun and pointed it, drawing fire by one officer. Schiwart retreated again. About an hour later the vehicle had moved and an officer spotted Schiwart pointing the shotgun and fired.About 6:40 p.m. Schiwart came out of the house peacefully and was taken to UF Health Jacksonville hospital.Smith said she did not know when Schiwart was wounded but said it appears it was one of the shots fired by police. Seven shots were fired by Officers M.W. Crawford, D.R. Hurley, D.J. Gianakas and N.A. Rodgers. Schiwart fired at least twice into the floor and twice at police.Police recovered a single-shot shotgun after the standoff. Smith said it appeared it was the only gun used, though there were several others in the house. Those belonged to Schiwart's mother and had been handed down by family.During the standoff, police evacuated nearby homes, a small day care and a small apartment complex behind the home. Two dogs in the house were not harmed, Smith said.Schiwart is charged with aggravated assault domestic violence for the shot fired at his mother, Smith said. Other charges, including attempted murder, could be added, she said.Times-Union writers Derek Gilliam and Joe Daraskevich contributed to this reportDana Treen: (904) 359-4091

1045,92549,"Jacksonville Sheriff's Office booking photo of Leonardo Little<strong>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</strong>According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Little was pulled over in a Buick sedan for having an expired tag about 7:35 p.m. just east of the intersection with of Interstate 295. Patrol Officer Cecil Grant, 28, discovered that Little was driving on a suspended license and had a criminal history. Little was asked to get out of the car and was being handcuffed when police say he took a swing and Officer Grant.
                                  ""There was a short foot-pursuit. The officer took his Taser out -- electronic control device -- deployed the Taser and struck him. This caused suspect to fall to the ground,"" JSO Director Tom Hackney said. ""When the officer got back to the subject, the fight continued. The wrestling went on there. (The) officer tried a second time to deploy (the) Taser (but it) did not deploy as (the) officer wished."" Hackney said Little eventually wrestled the Taser away from Grant. That's when the officer opened fire. Little was shot twice -- once in the mid-section and once in the leg -- and died at the scene. Grant, who has been with JSO for one year, was placed on administrative leave pending results of the investigation. 
                     According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Little had three previous arrests for domestic battery, two for resisting police and one for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was also a habitual traffic offender. 
                     Hackney said a female passenger in the car told investigators that Little told her while the officer was getting his information that he was ""not going to go back to jail.""  The woman was released without any criminal charges.
                     ""You just don't know what you're walking up to,"" Hackney said of a traffic stop. There's no such thing as a routine, it's one of the most dangerous things that law enforcement officers do. Numerous officers are killed each year from the side of the road.
                     This was the eighth suspect shot by police officers in Jacksonville so far this year; five of them died. Each case is investigated by the State Attorney's Office, then by a JSO Use Of Force panel.

1048,92689,"SAN DIEGO (CNS) - The San Ysidro port of entry reopened early Friday following a five-and-a-half-hour closure as officers pursued a stolen vehicle suspect who was wounded in an officer-involved shooting, authorities said. The chase began at 6:23 p.m. Thursday as patrol officers were altered to the stolen 2007 Chevy pickup truck being driven by a man in his 30s on southbound Interstate 15 at Mercy Road, San Diego police Lt. Jorge Duran said. They attempted to pull the truck over, but the driver, identified by San Diego police as 30-year-old Carlos Romero, continued on several roads before heading south on Interstate 5 toward the San Ysidro border crossing, Duran said. The driver initially came to a stop in the heavy border traffic, but then slammed the pickup into two police vehicles and a Border Patrol car as law enforcement officers approached on foot, Duran said. A San Diego police officer and a Border Patrol agent then opened fire, he said. The suspect suffered a gunshot wound to his leg, but was able to make a U-turn and drive north in the southbound freeway lanes to exit on Camino De La Plaza, according to the lieutenant.

1081,92704,"A rapper with close ties to Mazaradi Fox, 42, whose real name was Jamal Green, was killed at Farmers Blvd. and 134th Ave. in Jamaica about 4:10 p.m. when the shooter rolled up to his white SUV and opened fire.Police sources said Fox, released from prison just two weeks ago, stumbled out of the Nissan SUV and collapsed in a driveway.Three other people in the SUV were wounded, including a 21-year-old man who was hit in the neck and shoulder and was in critical condition, police said. A second man, age 22, was wounded in the arm, and the fourth victim, a woman in her 20s — believed to be Fox's daughter according to thisis50.com — suffered a graze wound to the neck, police said.Paramedics rushed the survivors to Jamaica Hospital.Fox, a native of Jamaica, Queens, got out of prison Dec. 20 after serving two years for an attempted assault. He was also convicted of attempted murder in 1998, according to court records.He was a childhood friend of 50 Cent and was affiliated with the ""In Da Club"" rapper's crew G-Unit. A spokesman for 50 Cent's record company said Fox never signed with the label.He ultimately parted company with 50 Cent and started his own rap label, Dumout, according to thisis50.com.Family friends said Fox helped raise D'Aja Robinson, a 14-year-old girl shot dead while riding on a city bus through Jamaica in May. Relatives of the murdered girl said they considered Fox to be D'Aja's stepfather.Fox and 50 Cent hadn't talked in some time, but 50 Cent attended D'Aja's funeral and paid for the horse and carriage that carried the teen's casket.50 Cent was in his New York studio when he heard Fox was murdered.""Saddened by the news of Mazaradi's tragic passing,"" he tweeted. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.""In a jailhouse interview in August 2013, Fox said he and 50 Cent were still friends.""We going to be homeboys till we're both buried I guess,"" he told DJ Self. ""That's my man forever.""It was unclear if the two rappers had reunited before Fox's death.He also told DJ Self he couldn't wait to get back to rapping.""I'm ready to get the money and get the business,"" he said. ""I'm ready now. I was young in the game and now I'm ready.""The Twitterverse was abuzz with news of Fox's slaying.""#RIP Mazaradi Fox,"" wrote @MikeBaggs. ""And it seemed like homie was tryna leave the streets alone too. That's the sad part.""""They say jail keeps some brothers alive,"" added @Shamoneyxl. ""He just came home 10 days ago and now he gone.""It was unclear how many shots were fired before the gunman, described only as a black man dressed all in black, fled in a dark-colored Hyundai sedan, according to sources.Cops were searching for the sedan Friday night.Residents were stunned by the bloodshed.""We're not used to this,"" said Tiffany Jackson, 19, who lives near the crime scene. ""This is a safe area. We don't have issues. I live next to a preacher and a post office.""The fatal shooting marks the city's fourth homicide of 2014.<em>With Kerry Burke, Rocco Parascandola and Brian Niemietz</em><a href=""mailto:jscarborough@nydailynews.com""><em>jscarborough@nydailynews.com</em></a>"

Detectives stood in the snow in the 1700 block of Ashburton St. in West Baltimore's Coppin Heights neighborhood, where a man had been shot several times, including in the head. Police said the unidentified man was not expected to survive.Police Commissioner Of the shootings, he said: ""The critical piece is that this is not gang-related, they do not appear to be drug-related. They're random incidents, and our job now is to connect the pieces of the puzzle and find out what's the background and what's the motive.""Batts said police would have a ""more active deployment"" this weekend and focus on known violent offenders.The latest shooting came on the heels of four people being shot on Wednesday and Thursday.

At some point, one of the teens shot the man in the hand with a rifle before both teens took off on foot.Detroit Police say the woman rushed her fiancée to the hospital, effectively abandoning her three younger children — all girls, ages 1, 4 and 5.When police went back to the crime scene to investigate the shooting, they found the girls alone with the gun. Sgt. Michael Woody said the girls were living in “horrible condition” without food or beds. Other officers have described the home as “deplorable,” with piles of feces scattered throughout its halls.“(Police) asked if an adult was home and the 5-year-old said ‘No’ and told the whole story,” Woody told the Detroit News.Authorities contacted Child Protective Services, which placed the girls in the care of their grandparents. The mother was arrested and could face charges, including child endangerment.Woody said police are still trying to track down the woman’s two sons.An investigation is ongoing.Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:

Neighbors say they heard screams and crashing coming from a Pasco apartment complex hours before police found a 46-year-old woman dead.When police arrived at the Vecinos Business Park at 720 W. Lewis St. late Friday night they found the woman dead inside an apartment, said Pasco police. A neighbor found the woman, whose name has not been released.“I can say that the crime was violent in nature,” Capt. Jim Raymond said. “She certainly was violently killed.”Police are awaiting results of an autopsy before releasing how the victim died.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.A man who lives in the apartments where neighbors say they heard cries for help and items breaking was arrested on suspicion of murder.Guadalupe Montejano, 47, was arrested at the complex and booked into the Franklin County jail, Raymond said.Montejano and the victim knew each other, though police are still working to figure out what their relationship was, Raymond said. Witnesses at the apartments pointed Montejano out to police. Neighbors heard a man and woman fighting inside Montejano’s apartment early Friday morning, they said.“We were lying down in bed and the woman was screaming and they were breaking things,” said a neighbor, who didn’t want to be named. “I almost dialed 911 but I was scared. I was scared he would hear me. I don’t like to start trouble.”There was constant yelling and arguing coming from Montejano’s apartment neighbors said. People who talked with the Herald say they rarely spoke to Montejano and saw two different women frequently visit his home.Neighbors watched as they say police blocked off an area near Montejano’s apartment and questioned potential witnesses into Saturday morning.“They were here until 3 or 4 in the morning,” said Ignacio Gudino-Hernandez, who lives down the hall from the suspect. “They came and asked us what happened. Nobody around here knows. We all keep to ourselves.”Montejano had lived at the low-income complex for about two months, said Victoria Galindo, who manages the apartments. He paid his rent on time and there had been no complaints about him. “So far, so good,” Galindo said. “We didn’t hear anything about him. I saw a ... lady with a dog going into his apartment yesterday but that was it.”The staff at the complex left their office around 8 p.m. Friday and were unaware a woman was killed, they said. The complex has 30 units which house about 40 people. Police are routinely called for disturbances there and the multiple cop cars that showed up when the victim was found didn’t worry many people, several residents said. “It was bound to happen with everybody around here,” said a neighbor, who didn’t want to be identified. “That’s the kind of apartments it is.”The complex does have issues with people drinking and sometimes has disturbances, but nothing ever as violent as a homicide, Galindo said. The woman’s death marks the first homicide in Pasco in more than a year, Raymond said.w Tyler Richardson: 582-1556; trichardson@tricityherald.com; Twitter: @Ty_richardson

1144,92901,"by Chris JilkaLITTLE ROCK (KATV) - A woman is recovering from gunshot wounds after  she reportedly got into a fight with a man who asked about her sexual  orientation Friday afternoon.  According to a Little Rock Police  Department incident report, around 12:30 p.m., 23-year-old Vallesha Boles told officers she  was walking into a gas station on the 3100 block of Roosevelt Road,  when a man inside the business approached her and asked her if she were  gay.  Boles reportedly said she did not know the man and it was none of his business, before the two began a fistfight. Boles  told police she walked outside after the fight and the suspect shot at  her several times, striking her in the leg and buttocks areas.

Cassandra Davis said.Davis said police responded to a shots-fired report about 12:36 p.m. at the SuperStop, 3100 W. Roosevelt Road. A caller said five shots had been fired.When police arrived at the scene, they found a woman, later identified as Vallesha Boles, suffering from at least one, non-life-threatening gunshot wound at the parking lot, according to a Little Rock Police Department report.At 1:30 p.m., investigators collected blood samples and shell casings at the scene, which was secured with crime-scene tape. Police said the shooter is described as a black man standing about 5-foot-7, between 20 and 30 years old, and was last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt with a stripe down the sleeve. He was last seen driving a gold Oldsmobile. <em>Information for this article was contributed by David Harten of Arkansas Online.</em>I sure wish the cops would catch that ""black man standing about 5-foot-7, between 20 and 30 years old"" and put a stop to his crime spree. That sucker is all over town robbing and stealing and shooting and raping. I don't know how he finds the time or the energy ....................He should at least take some of his unearned income and buy three or four different colored hoodies to enhance his ensemble.Another surplus gun..!!!  Thanks again, NRA..!!!  Even more guns is definitely the solution..!!! Black Male with a hoodie, seems to be the most common description in all the crime in the LR ghettoWhat happened to the creativity here? I hated the ""ban hoodies"" comments here last year, but now I miss 'em. Still, if you arrested every young black male in a hoodie in LR, they'd have to turn War Memorial into a jail...RBB, why not a mass grave?HOTDEMN; Food stamps and welfare.Copyright © 2018, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.All rights reserved.This document may not be reprinted without the express written permission of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.Material from the Associated Press is Copyright © 2018, Associated Press and may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

1155,92929,"Three men are under arrest in connection with the gunshot slaying Friday night of a 22-year-old man in the parking lot of a gasoline station at Maryland and White Bear Avenues in St. Paul.The arrests came even before the Ramsey County medical examiner’s office removed the victim’s body from inside the BP gasoline station shortly after midnight. Police said the man was shot outside. Others at the scene had apparently carried or dragged the victim inside as the suspects fled.Police had been called to the station at 6:30 p.m. about a man shot in the head. His sister, who later came to the station, said he was 22 years old, but declined to give his name. The medical examiner’s office would not release the man’s identity Saturday, and a police spokesman said no further information on the case would be released until Monday.Police had recovered a handgun at the scene, as well as surveillance camera images.Shortly after the slaying, two suspects were arrested at Regions Hospital, where they had arrived seeking treatment for one man with a gunshot wound to his arm.A 21-year-old St. Paul man with a history of second-degree armed assault and drug convictions was booked into the Ramsey County jail at 10:18 p.m., along with a 21-year-old Eagan man booked into the jail at 9:53 p.m. The Eagan man has a prior drug conviction.A third man was booked into the jail just before midnight.

1156,92929,"An 18-year-old man was charged Monday with murder, accused of shooting and killing a man during a botched drug deal at a St. Paul gas station.Antonio R. Seals, of St. Paul, was charged in Ramsey County District Court with second-degree murder in the death of Devonte R. Coppage, 22, of Brooklyn Park, who was shot Friday night at the BP gas ­station at Maryland and White Bear Avenues.According to a criminal complaint:Police responded to a report of shots fired around 6:30 p.m. and found Coppage dead inside the station.A man who identified himself as Coppage’s brother told police that Coppage had hung out at his home earlier that day before calling someone to buy marijuana. The brothers then went to the gas station to meet with the seller. When they arrived, one of three men in a dark-colored vehicle parked nearby motioned to them.After going into the gas station with one of the men, Coppage returned to the car and got into the back seat. He told his brother to wait outside the car near the gas station.A short time later, Coppage’s brother heard three to five gunshots. As the car sped away, he pulled his brother, who was on the ground in the parking lot, into the store to get him out of the cold.Police later found two sandwich baggies of marijuana, a .22-caliber handgun and blood on the north side of the gas station property.Not long after the shooting, a police officer spotted a dark blue car with three men inside pulling up quickly to Regions Hospital. The driver told police that he was dropping off a friend who had been shot. Police arrested the driver and towed the car.Officers tried to talk to a second man and also to Seals, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm, but they weren’t cooperative. Both were arrested. When Seals later talked to police, he gave them several different street ­locations where the shooting took place. When questioned again, Seals told police, “Dude shot me first.”Seals said that he used a friend’s phone to talk with Coppage about buying $300 worth of marijuana. He said that while in the car, Coppage acted like he was going to pull money out of his jacket but instead opened the door and shot Seals, Seals said. He then shot Coppage, Seals said.Police, however, told Seals that it appeared from the bullet recovered from his arm that he shot himself.On Saturday, police located a .38-caliber special revolver inside a stocking cap near Case Avenue and Omaban Street. They believe the bullet from Seals’ arm came from the .38-caliber handgun, according to the complaint.An autopsy revealed Coppage was shot multiple times.Coppage’s family wasn’t immediately available for ­comment Monday.The homicide was the city’s first this year. <p><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;""><strong>Nicole Norfleet </strong>covers commercial real estate along with professional services, including the Twin Cities' thriving marketing, accounting, and legal communities. </span></p> td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} © 2018 StarTribune.

1183,92976,"UPDATED: Sat., Jan. 4, 2014, 2:28 p.m.The Spokane Police Department Major Crimes detectives are investigating two shootings that took place on Friday but do not believe they are connected. Police were called to the Sacred Heart Hospital Emergency Room just before 8:30 p.m. Friday after hospital workers reported that a woman with multiple gunshot wounds to her chest had been dropped off. The woman was able to give some information to police, which led them to the crime scene at the Wendy’s parking lot on Division Street just north of North River Drive, said Major Crimes Lt. Mark Griffiths. The woman’s car was found in the Zip’s parking lot several blocks north of the crime scene.“We have not had an opportunity to interview her fully,” Griffiths said. The woman, whom police are not naming, is expected to survive. The second shooting was reported by a neighbor who heard a gunshot just before 10 p.m. at 2228 N. Astor St. Police discovered a man dead from a gunshot wound when they arrived, Griffiths said. His identity will be released after an autopsy is complete. Police are not releasing suspect information for either shooting but the incidents are not random, said Griffiths. Witnesses are still being interviewed. “We believe the victims and the perpetrators are known to each other,” he said. “There were multiple people involved in both incidents. We are investigating everybody who could be connected.”Get the day’s top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning by subscribing to our newsletterUPDATED: 6:23 p.m.UPDATED: 6:23 p.m.© Copyright 2018, The Spokesman-Review | "

1242,93787,"MIAMI (CBSMiami) – A grieving mother and father are asking for the public’s help after their 21-year-old son was gunned down while trying to break up a fight at a pre-baptism party.Ironically, the victim had hoped to become a crime scene investigator.“My boy was good. He never got in any trouble,” said Acelia Desinor, whose son Wilson Alexis was shot and killed when he intervened and tried to stop a fight between four to five females and a male inside a home at N.E.159“He was trying to help them out and help them get out of the fight and break it up,” said Alexis’s father Francoeur Alexis.He said it was in his son’s nature to keep people from hurting each other.Alexis told CBS4’s Peter D’Oench, “I feel so sad. I feel so sad. I am so sorry for him. He was a 21-year-old who never had any serious problems. He never got in a fight or trouble. This is terrible.”“Wilson was a good boy,” said Alexis. “He was done with high school at Miami Edison Senior High at 17 years old. He went Miami-Dade College for a year. He took some time off. He wanted to be a crime scene investigator.”North Miami Beach Police said the shooting happened just after 4 a.m. last Sunday after a large number of uninvited guests showed up at the house after a notice about the party was posted on the social media website TAGGED.A number of fights broke out during that party, according to police. The first fight broke out over food and a lack of proper utensils. Police say that lead to an argument between one of the party guests and a kitchen helper.That’s when members of the Joseph family decided to end the party. Then police say that’s when the second fight broke out that Alexis tried to stop.Jameson Joseph told D’Oench “The party was going on and then one fight broke out over food. It was all supposed to just be a pre-baptism party for my five month-old godchild. I wished it never happened. I feel terrible about this. I wished it never happened.”Another member of the Joseph family declined to give her name but said, “What happened was not supposed to happen. It was just a celebration of a baptism. It just got out of control.”“If whoever did this could come forward that would be great because innocent people are being questioned who had nothing to do with this,” she said. “If you did it and it was self-defense, come forward and say something.”Police say they have been questioning about 20 people who were at the party. But they say as many as 80 other guests took off. And they would like to question them to find out if they can identify the shooter.“It would be appreciated if people would call,” said Francoeur Alexis. “Call the police department. Please let someone know. You don’t have to give your name. You can be kept secret. We need to catch the killer.”If you can help North Miami Beach Police with this case, call them or Miami-Dade Crimestoppers at (305) 471-TIPS (8477).Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:

Michael Jerome Thomas, of Wilton Manors, is facing multiple counts of armed burglary, grand theft, petty theft, kidnapping and false imprisonment in connection with the Jan. 4 incident. He also was charged with home invasion and robbery with a firearm. According to a police report read in court by Broward Judge John ""Jay"" Hurley during Thomas' first-appearance court hearing, Thomas called a woman who lived in the home to allow him to visit her. When he got to the home, he went into her bedroom and took out a revolver, he said. ""At gunpoint, you demanded money, took her money, ordered her to lay on the floor,"" the judge said.Thomas went on to rob several other people who also lived in the home, which had been partitioned into seven bedrooms that were rented out on a weekly basis, Hurley said.Thomas allegedly told the home's residents that if they didn't comply, they would be shot. Citing an ongoing investigation and the possibility of additional arrests, a Wilton Manors police spokesman Tuesday declined to provide additional information about the incident. "

Officer Jerry Roberts reported that he examined the car and saw a large amount of blood on top of the vehicle, on the windshield and in the front passenger compartment. He also saw a black pistol that appeared to be loaded on the center console of the locked car. Roberts reported that the car’s sunroof was shattered and there was glass inside and outside of the car.When questioned by officers, the victim became combative and tried to walk away. He was detained by EMS and Covington Fire Department personnel and eventually cooperated in getting into an ambulance. When questioned by a member of the rescue team, the victim reportedly said, “I shot myself because I was trying to go home.”An examination of the victim revealed that he had what appeared to be a gunshot wound under his chin and a possible exit wound near his left eye. He was transported to Atlanta Medical Center for treatment.According to police, the victim is expected to recover.

A 26-year-old man who police say accidentally shot himself in the leg Saturday in Pasco is a suspect in a Spokane homicide. Pasco police were called to a motel on the 2800 block of N. 20th Ave. around 9:40 p.m. after Brandon Mellon apparently shot himself in the leg, police officials said Sunday. Mellon was taken to Kadlec Regional Medical Center in Richland before being transported to a Portland hospital, police said. Mellon is in critical condition and is under police supervision at the hospital. Spokane police have probable cause to arrest Mellon for first-degree murder following a shooting that took place Friday night at a north Spokane apartment complex, said Monique Cotton, spokeswoman for the Spokane Police Department. A man, whose name has not been released, was shot to death at the complex. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.Police will request the Spokane County Prosecutor’s Office charge Mellon with first-degree murder and expect a warrant to be issued for his arrest, Cotton said. Once the warrant is issued, detectives plan to officially arrest Mellon and work on bringing him back to Spokane. Mellon will have to recover from his gunshot wound and there is no time frame for his return to Spokane, Cotton said.“Because he was taken across state lines it will make it more difficult for us to bring him into custody,” she said. Spokane detectives determined Mellon was a person of interest in the shooting during their initial investigation, Cotton said. Information about the shooting and Mellon was entered in a database that is shared with other police agencies. Pasco and Spokane police were able to work together to determine Mellon was wanted for the shooting, Cotton said. Officers found a gun at the motel where Mellon reportedly shot himself, police said. It’s unclear if the weapon was used in Friday’s shooting.

Damyan Brown said the suspect was sent to the hospital with more than one gunshot wound, but he couldn’t say what the suspect’s condition was.

Somebody's son, brother, grandson, friend pulled the trigger and those who know him, know that he is capable of doing this and allow him to walk the streets armed. Blacks could put a stop to this if they really wanted to. Unfortunately, th*ggery is celebrated instead of discouraged... sorry, I'm all out of sympathy for this group.Another killing by a person who ILLEGALLY possessed a firearn.  How does banning firearms to law abiding citizens, help curb this kind of crime?Durham is off the charts the cops don't have a clue. the criminals are running durham if it don't turn around in 5 years this place won't be fit for decent people thanks libsMore of the same ol comments.  Its the gun's fault. Why can't liberals actually place the blame where it belongs with the person who committed first degree murder.Someone knows what happened and who did it. It's not a secret. If the community is not willing to turn on the dirtbags . . . . .

			Trending:		SAN LEANDRO — San Leandro police recovered guns from armed suspects in two separate incidents Saturday, a police official said today. In the first incident, San Leandro officers conducted a traffic stop at Bancroft and 109th avenues in Oakland around 1:35 a.m., police said. The suspect fled on foot, and threw a loaded handgun on the ground as officers gave chase. The suspect was taken into custody after a struggle involving the use of a police dog that resulted in minor injuries to an officer and moderate injuries to the suspect, police said. The handgun was recovered, police said. Around 2:17 a.m., a police sergeant contacted a parked vehicle at the San Leandro Marina occupied by two subjects. As the sergeant approached the passenger side, he saw a suspect inside loading a handgun, according to police. As support arrived, the sergeant was able to detain the suspect and driver. The passenger was arrested on suspicion of possession of a stolen weapon, police said. Suspects in both incidents were Oakland residents, according to police.

Police said they responded to a 911 “burglary” call from the home placed at 2:57 a.m. Sunday. Moon was pronounced dead at 4:30 a.m. at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center.According to information released Monday by police, Moon was a resident of the home, and the shooter was his brother. The investigation revealed Moon left the residence Saturday evening and told his brother he was not coming home that night.Moon’s brother, whom police did not identify, locked the renter’s dead bolt on the door. Police said Moon came home unexpectedly, and was unable to get into the house through the front door. He went around to his brother’s window and began to open it.“At this point, his brother believed an intruder was breaking into his home and fired a shot, hitting him,” KPD said.Moon’s brother immediately called 911 for assistance, police said.A person who answered the door of the residence Monday said no one wanted to talk about the incident.An autopsy report released Monday listed the cause of Moon’s death as a shotgun wound to the head, calling the incident a homicide.Moon’s brother was taken into custody and later released after the Bell County district attorney’s office declined to file charges.Contact Madison Lozano​ at

Avelar called 911 on Sunday about 5:25 p.m. to report the shooting at their apartment, 2804 Independence St., Metairie. Deputies arrived and found Avelar's boyfriend lying in bed with a wound to the left side of his chest, the report said. Avelar told investigators the gun discharged as she was moving the .22-caliber pistol from a dresser drawer to another location. She said she didn't think the gun was loaded because there was no magazine, the report said. Avelar told investigators she pulled the trigger and the bullet struck her boyfriend.Avelar said she was standing 4 feet away from the man when she fired the gun. But the deputy noted a gunpowder burn on the victim's chest, which indicates a ""close-range contact,"" the incident report said. Avelar could not explain why she was moving the gun, and she insisted the shooting was accidental, the report said. In addition to the aggravated battery charge, Avelar was also booked with possession of a stolen firearm after investigators determined the gun had been reported stolen from someone in Arkansas in 2011, an arrest report said. Avelar was still being held Thursday at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna on a $30,000 bond. It was not clear whether the shooting victim would face any charges in connection with the stolen gun.

With the other hand, she says she shot the sixteen year- old in the chest.She says this is the second time the young man robbed her in her own home. The last time this happened she says he stole her gun and some money. But she bought another gun.This time when the shotgun wielding man reportedly barged into her home, her gun was in the safe – a tactical advantage she would use without even thinking.""And I said here you go, and he let go of one hand off his gun, because it was pointed right at me, and reached for the bag of coins, and that's when I fired my gun, and hit him with the first round,"" said the woman.Police found the young man a short distance away from the home after he had collapsed. He was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.""55 dollars in coins, and he lost his life,"" said the tearful woman.

The 24-year-old limped to the front of the courtroom Monday to hear the man he grew up with plead guilty to shooting him three times Jan. 5, leaving him with irreparable nerve damage in his hip.The victim did not address the court as DiAngilo Antuan Bell, 23, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault.But his father did.The father was outraged at Bell’s betrayal of his son’s friendship: “This man has been to my house,” he said of Bell. “He played with my son.” Bell had shared dinner with his family, the father said, yet Bell still tried to kill his son.No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.So, whatever sentence Superior Court Judge Maureen Gottfried gave Bell, “I don’t think it’s going to be strong enough,” the father said.Gottfried sentenced Bell to 10 years in prison with five to serve, and the rest on probation. She also ordered him never again to have any contact with the victim’s family.Bell’s Atlanta defense attorney Lamar Rhodes sought a more lenient penalty, asking that Bell serve only three years. Again the father argued Bell deserved more time – of his son saying, “He’s going to suffer the rest of his life.”Neither Bell nor the victim would disclose any motive for the assault. Bell, who disputed facts of the case as recited by Senior Assistant District Attorney Don Kelly, told Gottfried he would suffer by being separated from his son while in prison. “No hard feelings to the victim,” he added. “I still love him like a brother.”That was not evident from the way Bell assaulted his longtime friend earlier this year at 1052 Winston Road in Columbus, an area now infamous for shootings and homicides, authorities said.‘Kelly said the victim’s mother dropped him off at some apartments there, where he was to meet a friend. He was outside when a car pulled up and Bell got out, covering the lower half of his face with a bandana.Bell pulled out a handgun and opened fire, striking the other man in the neck, wrist and hip, the latter wound causing permanent injury. As Bell fled, the victim went to a nearby apartment for help. The resident there let him in, called the police and put pressure on the his wounds to reduce the bleeding.As an ambulance rushed the victim to the hospital, the apartment resident reported to officers the man had told him “Lo,” the name by which he knew Bell, had shot him. The victim later picked Bell’s picture from a photographic lineup.Police got warrants to arrest Bell, who surrendered to officers on Jan. 17.In delivering Bell’s sentence, Gottfried told Bell he was lucky the victim suffered only “lifelong scars,” as he could have died from his wounds.“Frankly, it’s a miracle you’re not facing a murder charge,” the judge said.It would not have been Columbus’ first or only homicide on Winston Road.On Nov. 8, 2013, 27-year-old Terrell Screws of 8344 Twin Chapel Drive was pronounced dead at 10:49 p.m. from multiple bullet wounds sustained on the street outside 1042 Winston Road, investigators said.This past Aug. 21, 16-year-old Christopher Jones died from a gunshot wound to the head during an exchange of fire that led to Jones’ crashing his bullet-riddled car at Winston Road and Head Street. Police called to the shooting at 10:10 p.m. found Jones still in the driver’s seat.Two passengers who’d been in the vehicle with Jones, one 14 and the other 15, were charged with felony murder for their part in the incident. Felony murder means they allegedly caused someone’s death while committing a felony, whether they meant to or not.Also arrested during the investigation was 44-year-old Antonio Robinson who lived in Winston Road’s 1000 block. He was charged with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime and keeping a disorderly house.Winston Road residents told the Ledger-Enquirer multiple shots were fired during the incident. One witness said he heard what sounded like an automatic weapon.About 11 p.m. this past May 25, a man was wounded in the hand and thigh during a drive-by shooting on Winston Road. ""A car drove by, then came back by on a second pass,"" police Lt. John McMichael told the Ledger-Enquirer. ""Someone was hanging out the window and fired at them.""The man was treated and released from The Midtown Medical Center.

Police arrested Impastato was charged with felony possession of a destructive weapon (a handgun with an illegal silencer), shooting a firearm within a safety zone near a home, trespassing to hunt, unlicensed hunting, hunting deer during a closed season, and hunting deer illegally. A shotgun and handgun were seized as evidence. Bowden was charged with shooting a firearm within a safety zone close to a home, possession of an unplugged shotgun, trespassing to hunt, unlicensed hunting, and hunting deer illegally. Another shotgun was seized as evidence. Both men were arraigned in Georgetown, according to DNREC. Impastato was released on $2,725 unsecured bond and Bowden was released on $250 unsecured bond, pending a trial.

He add that it is illegal in Delaware for anyone other than the owner, or someone with permission from the owner, to use a firearm that lands on an occupied dwelling. DNREC says the statewide safety zone for in-season archery deer hunting is 50 yards. New Castle County has its own ordinances, including a 200-yard firearm safety zone from homes, structures and camps north of I-295 and I-95 in which firearms may not be discharged, and a 100-yard firearm safety zone south of I-295 and I-95. Within these safety zones, it is illegal for anyone other than the owner or occupant to hunt, trap, pursue, disturb or otherwise chase any wild animal or bird without advance permission of the owner or occupant, according to DNREC.  For hunting information, you can look at the 2013-2014 Delaware Hunting & Trapping Guide at People in one Somerset County community are shocked after finding out one of their Elementary teachers is charged with allowing a man to sexually assault her 10 year old relative. That teacher is 30 year-old Brittney Hughes of Salisbury, Md.

Edward Domasinsky was released from the hospital and arrested this week, nine months after allegedly shooting at his girlfriend and then shooting himself in the face. A Clinton man accused of shooting at his girlfriend in January is the first person to be monitored electronically under a new program in Somerset County.Edward Domasinsky, 56, shot himself in the face after that Jan. 5 incident at his home on Horseback Road and was hospitalized until Wednesday afternoon.Maeghan Maloney, district attorney in Kennebec and Somerset counties, said he was arrested Friday and faces charges of felony aggravated assault and domestic violence assault. After an initial appearance Friday in Augusta District Court, he was released on unsecured bail that bars him from contacting the victim. However, conditions approved by a judge made him the first person in Maine to be monitored electronically by a district attorney’s office before a trial, Maloney said.It’s being done under a first-of-its-kind program in Maine Money to start the program In Domasinsky’s case, Maloney said the defendant agreed to the monitoring after the victim asked for it. Maloney said his medical condition makes it impossible for him to be held in jail — he has a tracheostomy, feeding tubes and two types of cancer — but he still can walk and drive and could harm the victim.The victim is “terrified that he has nothing to lose,” Maloney said, “so she wanted something to keep her safe.”The device is programmed to send a signal to the Somerset County Regional Communications Center if someone in the program enters an area from which he or she is banished by bail conditions. That’s when dispatchers would alert law enforcement.Maloney said Domasinsky’s conditions bar him from Somerset County, where the victim lives, except for Fairfield, where he attends doctors’ appointments.An affidavit from a Clinton police officer, released by the court on Friday, said Domasinsky’s then-girlfriend told him that after an argument in January, Domasinsky hit her in the face with his fists and choked her until she passed out.When she awoke, the victim said Domasinsky was holding her at gunpoint. He pulled the trigger, but she said she deflected the shotgun’s barrel and suffered only powder burns to her shoulder. After that, he hit her with the gun’s barrel, loaded it and shot himself.She fled at that point and thought she was wounded when she reached the home of a neighbor a quarter-mile away. The neighbor called 911 and Domasinsky drove to the neighbor’s home, but the homeowner armed himself and asked Domasinsky to leave.When police arrived, they found Domasinsky sitting in his truck at his home, conscious. He was taken to Maine Medical Center in Portland by a LifeFlight helicopter. Domasinsky’s aggravated assault charge is a class B felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.Maloney said the GPS device was put on his right ankle. On Friday evening, she said she knew where Domasinsky was.“He is at home right now, and the bracelet is reporting properly,” she said.<i>Michael Shepherd — 370-7652</i><i><a href=""/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7b1608131e0b131e091f5e4f4b181e150f091a17161a12151e5518141644080e19111e180f46291e5e483a5e494b22140e095e494b1a090f1218171e""><span class=""__cf_email__"" data-cfemail=""076a746f62776f627563476462697375666b6a666e69622964686a"">[email protected]</span></a></i><i><a href=""/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#137e607b76637b76617736272370767d6761727f7e727a7d763d707c7e2c606671797670672e41763620523621234a7c66613621237261677a707f76""></a>Twitter: <a href="""">@mikeshepherdme</a></i>

The officers fired at Causey, but no one was injured.Causey and Robinson then fled, and police set up a perimeter in the area. The two were apprehended by canine units after they were found hiding under a house. Both suspects were taken to an area hospital with dog bites. The injuries are considered minor, and the two will be booked when they are treated, police said.Police did not specify where the house is. Two guns were found there; one had an extended magazine, police said.Causey had been arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm, heroin and marijuana possession, battery and possession of stolen property, among other charges, police said.Robinson was being sought by police on charges of aggravated assault, illegal carrying of a weapon, battery and resisting a police officer, among other charges. He was previously arrested for second-degree murder, battery on a police officer, several resisting a police officer and flight from a police officer charges, as well as other drug and weapon charges.Since the officer's gun was fired, the NOPD and Independent Police Monitor are conducting separate investigations into the incident.

1444,93663,"A 21-year-old Des Moines man already charged with first-degree robbery now faces additional charges after King County prosecutors filed allegations against him Wednesday for two more armed robberies and a shooting in recent months.Most of the incidents reportedly occurred in the First Hill area.Mohamed Abdi Ali, known as “Sharmarke,” had failed to show up for his arraignment after being charged with first-degree robbery in January and has reportedly been on the lam since as additional charges have piled up against him.The January charges include two counts of illegal firearm possession in addition to the robbery charge. Those charges are tied to a Dec. 13 incident near 12th Avenue South and South Main Street in which a taxi driver was pistol-whipped and robbed of his phone and GPS device by a group of men.Now, Ali is linked to a January One robbery reportedly occurred Nov. 15, when a man reported being pistol-whipped and strangled in his car near 12th Avenue South and South Main Street — the same area where the taxi driver was robbed — and carjacked by a group of men, according to court records. The victim jumped out of his vehicle while one of the attackers drove the car away and Ali reportedly sat in the back seat next to the victim. Ali was supposedly acquainted with the victim.The shooting occurred Jan. 5 near the intersection of East Remington Court and 12th Avenue, where a man reportedly ran into Ali, who confronted him about a fight the man had the previous week with Ali’s brother. The man was shot at four to five times and struck twice. He drove himself to Harborview Medical Center. He ultimately recovered after spending a week in the hospital, according to a bail request memo.The final robbery for which Ali is charged occurred Jan. 10 at Hashi Money Wire in the 15200 block of International Boulevard in SeaTac. A man robbed the business of about $7,000 after pointing a gun at the clerk, court documents say. Detectives linked surveillance footage of the incident to Ali.Investigators found the vehicle in which Ali reportedly fled the robbery scene and recovered a stolen handgun from inside the car.Ali has previous convictions of vehicle theft, possession of stolen property, assault and theft, among others."
